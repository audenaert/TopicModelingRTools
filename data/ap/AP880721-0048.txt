 Illinois Republican Gov. James Thompson came to this convention city to taunt the Democrats, but wound up hinting that he'd make a good running mate for GOP candidate George Bush. As the Democrats embraced the ticket of Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, who differ on a number of issues, Thompson stressed his compatibility with the vice president. ``George Bush and I agree on a lot of things,'' said Thompson, a four-term governor who was an early Bush supporter. ``I'm too moderate for some people, but I've never been told I'm too moderate for George Bush,'' he said. Thompson was careful to avoid sounding overly eager as a job applicant. Vice presidential hopefuls traditionally refrain from tooting their own horns. ``There are a number of qualified candidates,'' Thompson said. ``There's no lack of talent in our party.'' Thompson's support gave Bush a boost in the Illinois primary, where he thrashed his GOP rivals after an impressive showing in the South. Since then, Thompson has been mentioned as a vice presidential prospect, and ``Thompson-Bush'' bumper stickers have appeared in Springfield, the Illinois capital. Thompson was in Atlanta on Wednesday to carry the GOP banner. He clearly relished the task, signaling what's certain to be a Republican effort to focus attention on Jesse Jackson as part of the Democratic team. ``Gov. Dukakis has accepted Jesse Jackson as his partner in this campaign, elevated him to a position equal to or perhaps higher than his nominal running mate, Lloyd Bentsen,'' Thompson told reporters. Thompson said it was a clever strategy by Dukakis to offer Bentsen as ``the soothing, reassuring conservative.'' But he said, ``my guess is those two partners of the troika, Dukakis and Jackson, will soon leave Bentsen in the dust.'' Thompson added: ``With Bentsen whispering in one ear and Jackson whispering in his other ear, who is Dukakis going to listen to? ... I think that's the question the American people need to have answered.''
