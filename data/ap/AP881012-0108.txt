 Oct. 7 Waco (Texas) Tribune-Herald on the vice presidential debate: By all criteria _ style or substance _ Lloyd Bentsen was a lopsided winner in (the) vice presidential debate. Dan Quayle's only claim was that he was still standing. Call it a technical knockout. Sure, Bentsen overplayed the need for a ``tough'' trade policy (a trade war perhaps?) as a miracle cure for the American economy. But in other policy matters _ like welfare reform, the environment and defense burden-sharing by American allies _ he was resonant. Bentsen was perhaps most convincing in explaining that he can differ in degree with Michael Dukakis. On Contra aid (which he favors and Dukakis opposes), Bentsen criticized the Reagan administration for banking so heavily on military force that regional diplomacy is disregarded outright. Bentsen was also right on the shaky foundations of Reaganomics _ an economy propped up by foreign debt and deficit spending (``$200 billion in hot checks''). Quayle was left to give a testimonial to foreign entrepreneurs. Dukakis still has a lot of convincing to do to show his mettle as a leader, but Bentsen's performance helps him a lot. The senator from Texas came off as a real Dukakis asset _ a man of competence and moderation.
