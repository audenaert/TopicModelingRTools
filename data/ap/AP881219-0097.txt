 A fire department medical truck hit an 8-year-old boy who darted between parked cars, but the driver saved the boy's life by resuscitating him, officials said. Thomas Adkins, 8, was injured so severely in Saturday's accident that he went into cardiac arrest, police said. The driver, Gary E. Warren, 36, the second in command of the Baltimore County Fire Department's medical division, administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation and saved the child's life, police said. The boy was reported in stable condition Monday at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He sustained two broken legs, a broken collarbone, head and stomach trauma and bruised lungs. Warren was ticketed for driving 43 mph in a 25 mph zone. ``He had been through a lot in the emergency medical technician field,'' said Officer John Emerick of the police traffic investigation unit. ``But actually hitting that child accidentally really tore him up.''
