 Former President Carter described Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis as ``highly competent'' on Tuesday and said Dukakis would fare well against Republican George Bush in the Nov. 8 general election. ``I know him well. He and I were governors together,'' said Carter, who was governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and won the presidency in 1976. Carter said the Massachusetts governor ``is highly competent. I think among all the governors, he would be voted one of the top ones in administrative ability, in vision and competence and sound judgment.'' Carter said Dukakis' nomination was ``the obvious likelihood now'' and predicted ``he will do well'' against Bush. As a former Democratic president, Carter is a delegate to the convention in Atlanta this summer. He said it is still his intention to go to the convention as an uncommitted delegate because he told the candidates earlier that he would not choose among them until the convention.
