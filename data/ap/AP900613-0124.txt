 Georgette Mosbacher, socialite wife of the U.S. secretary of commerce and head of a cosmetics company she owns, was robbed of $30,000 in jewelry and cash outside her hotel room by a man with a submachine gun. Mrs. Mosbacher said she gave the robber her jewelry and handbag, then escaped when an elevator opened and she jumped in. ``I was screaming and yelling and leaning on the buzzer,'' Mrs. Mosbacher said after the Tuesday robbery. ``When I got to the lobby, I ran to the desk. I was hoping they could lock off the stairs and catch him.'' The robber fled. No arrests have been made, police said Wednesday. Mrs. Mosbacher said the well-dressed robber covered her with the small submachine gun and told her to open her door. She said she told him the key wouldn't work, but he got it open. ``I told him `I'm not going there. I'm not going to shout.' ``I took off my earrings and said, `There's a bench over there and I'm going to sit.' I said to myself, `I'm not going to live,' but I thought I'd have a better chance in the hallway,'' she recalled. The gunman's hands were occupied with jewelry and Mrs. Mosbacher's bag when the elevator door opened and Mrs. Mosbacher took her chance to get away. The robber got her wedding band, two other rings, a watch, $400 in cash and the earrings, she said. She said the valuables were worth $30,000. Mrs. Mosbacher was staying at the hotel while the couple's apartment is being renovated.
