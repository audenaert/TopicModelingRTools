 Kelsey Grammer of ``Cheers'' was jailed Thursday for a drunken driving probation violation. The 35-year-old actor, who plays brainy psychiatrist Frasier Crane on the hit NBC series, surrendered to the Van Nuys Muncipal Court and was taken immediately to County Jail. He showed up in court with a toothbrush stuck in his shirt pocket. Since his February 1988 conviction for drunken driving, he has failed to make several court appearances to prove he completed a drug rehabilitation program. Municipal Court Commissioner Patricia Schwartz last week ordered Grammer to serve a 30-day sentence for failing to attend the program and failing to serve 10 days on a state road crew. The commissioner also ordered Grammer to show up in court Thursday with proof he served at least one day of work on a California Department of Transportation road cleanup crew and enrolled in a 90-day drug rehab program. Documentation presented by Grammer on Thursday established he had completed those obligations, the court clerk said. Grammer still faces possible possession of cocaine charges. In April 1988, police stopped his car for expired license tags and a routine check showed an arrest warrant had been issued for missing a court appearance. While riding in the police car, a packet of cocaine fell from his pocket, officers said. Earlier this month, Grammer surrendered to authorities on arrest warrants involving both the drunken driving and cocaine arrests. The incarceration shouldn't affect production of the show, which is currently shut down between seasons.
