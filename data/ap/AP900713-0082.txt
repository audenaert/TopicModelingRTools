 A woman who has camped for two years in front of the motel where Martin Luther King Jr. died was ordered today to get out of the way of workmen building a museum. Chancery Court Judge George Lewis said he would send in sheriff's deputies at noon Saturday to move protester Jacqueline Smith if she defied his order. Ms. Smith promised to stay. ``Right now, I don't have no intention of moving no place,'' she said as she left Lewis' courtroom. Lewis denied her request to delay the hearing days while she tried to find a lawyer to represent her. He said she has had ample time to find a lawyer. Ms. Smith has been camped on a sidewalk in front of the Lorraine Motel, where she was a former employee and resident, since March 1988. She contends the motel should be used as housing for the homeless, not as a museum. King was assassinated at the Lorraine in 1968. The $9 million museum, called The National Civil Rights Center, is being built by the state, county and city governments. It is to open July 4, 1991. Lewis said Ms. Smith must carry on her protest somewhere other than the museum site. She has refused requests to move to a sidewalk across the street. ``The court has no alternative except to order her out of the way of the construction,'' Lewis said. His order came on a petition from Jameson-Vaccaro Construction Co. Inc., the primary contractor for the museum. Anthony Vaccaro, project manager, said Ms. Smith is camped in a spot that must be torn up for utility lines.
