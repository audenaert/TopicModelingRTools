 One of five soldiers injured in a training accident last week has died, bringing the death toll in Operation Desert Shield to 81, the U.S. military's Central Command announced Monday. The soldiers from the 3/320th Field Artillery of the 101st Airborne Division were participating in a training exercise Thursday when a 105mm howitzer exploded, the military said. One of the soldiers, who had been in a coma, died Sunday, the military said. His name was withheld pending notification of next of kin. The cause of the accident is under investigation. Two sailors from the aircraft carrier USS Midway also died Sunday when their tour bus overturned on a liberty excursion, the military's Joint Information Bureau announced Monday. Five other sailors were injured, two seriously, in the accident 50 miles south of al-Dhafra airbase in Abu Dhabi. On Saturday in the Mediterranean, a chartered Israeli ferry carrying U.S. sailors capsized while returning to the USS Saratoga from the Israeli port of Haifa, killing 21 sailors.
