Got to rapping with the gang And the Rich Academy guys gave him some slang: ``He left Ford Motor Company with a plan on the double. Became Chrysler's CEO, found out they were in trouble. He designed a new automobile, they called the `K.' His new car and charming wit surely saved the day.'' Student Chris Longino got in the entrepreneurial way: ``I'm going to keep this (song). I might make some money off this one day.'' Translated: The Chrysler Corp. chairman visited the 9-year-old alternative school on Thursday.
