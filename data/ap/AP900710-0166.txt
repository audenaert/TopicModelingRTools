 A manufacturer of outdoor picnic equipment on Tuesday recalled hoses for 30,000 smoker-cookers because of possible fire hazards. The Coleman Co., Inc. recalled the hoses that connect to the propane gas tanks of its ``Cookin' Machines'' because they may loosen from the valve connection after repeated use, said the Consumer Product Safety Commission. ``If the hose should loosen when the valve is turned on, fuel may leak from the hose and could present a risk of personal injury or property damage if ignited,'' the agency said. There have been at least five reported incidents of loosened hoses causing fire damage, said the CPSC. The potentially hazardous hoses are installed on cookers manufactured by the Kansas-based company between November 1987 and March 1989. Consumers should discontinue use of the cookers immediately and contact Coleman at 1-800-835-3278 for instructions on free replacement of the hoses.
