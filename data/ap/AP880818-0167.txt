 Jerry Dorris is one person who would like to see the Republican National Convention last longer. Business at his video rental store is up 20 percent as a prime alternative to all the political talk. ``I wish the conventions were each two months long and were held every year,'' said Dorris, owner of Landmark Video in the Empire State Building, where comedies and action adventures were alternatives to acceptance speeches. ``The majority of our customers want to be entertained after a day of work. They don't want to be bored by the convention. The general comment is they've had enough and they'd much rather watch a movie,'' Dorris said Thursday. A spot check of other stores indicated movie fans have elected to tune out the George Bush and Dan Quayle show, which has filled prime time for the three networks, and flicked to fantasyland instead. ``The Manchurian Candidate'' was doing well in some areas, but political movies such as ``All The President's Men,'' ``The Candidate'' with Robert Redford and ``Advise and Consent'' gathered dust on the shelves. Nor was there much demand for Ronald Reagan's ``Bedtime For Bonzo'' or ``Knute Rockne _ All-American,'' the movie where he first asked his mentor to win one for the Gipper. ``People are pretty bored with the convention,'' said Sue Granat, salesperson at New York City's Videoroom, where rentals are up 25 percent. ``There hasn't been a good convention since the Democrats in 1968. That had drama and violence,'' she said. Rentals also increased during the Democratic gathering in Atlanta, but the earlier convention at least had some electricity between Jesse Jackson and Miachel Dukakis, store officials said. At the Video Circus, rentals were up 33 percent for the week. ``Everyone is complaining, coming in here and saying they don't want to be bored,'' said store owner Frank Lopez. ``I guess it's important, but it's quite monotonous after a while. I mean, really, four days of that stuff?''
