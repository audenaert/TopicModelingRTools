 A day in February when millions of Britons wore red clown noses reaped $25 million for British and African charities, organizers said. ``Comic Relief Day'' was held for the first time on Feb. 5, and accompanied by a seven-hour ``laughathon'' on television, which raised the bulk of donations through telephone pledges. Two million donors also paid nearly $1 each for a red nose. Bankers in pin stripes, school children, secretaries and others wearing the bulbous badge were a common sight. Even Prince Andrew, second son of Queen Elizabeth II, posed for photographers in a red nose. Organizers on Monday said the funds would be used to help famine victims in Africa and poor youths in Britain.
