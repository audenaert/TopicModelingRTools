 Making the jump from high school senior to college freshman may be traumatic for a youngster, but what about the parent? Pete Goldsmith, dean of student life at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., has some advice for being a ``successful'' college parent: _ Stay informed. Read the school's newsletters and other information that is generally sent to you by the college. Get your own copy of the college catalog and student handbook. _ Get involved. Check into any parents' associations at the school. In addition to feeling more a part of the college, you'll make new friends. _ Communicate. Don't hesitate to call if you are concerned about something innvolving the college or your child. _ Expect change. There will be times you may not like what your child is doing or uncomfortable with thoughts expressed, but be patient and understanding. And be flexible. _ Provide challenge and support. It's like teaching a child to swim: the parent decides when to let him flounder and when to rescue him. The college experience is no different. Parents need to decide when to provide encouragement and when to intervene. When it comes to financial support beyond tuition, room, board and books, take a walk through the campus, the bookstore and the town. You'll gain a sense of what's appropriate. _ Show your interest. Ask about academic work. Visit the campus on Parents' Weekend or other special occasions. _ Trust your student. You'd be surprised at the common sense most students display.
