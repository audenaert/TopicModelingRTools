 For years on TV's ``Newhart,'' John Voldstad only grinned when introduced by brother Larry as one of the silent Darryls. But he managed recently to get out the words ``I do'' and wed 20-year-old Kellye Fowler in Gadsden, Ala. Voldstad, 39, who played the chubby, blond Darryl, met Kellye in August when he was playing tennis in a celebrity tournament in Macon, Ga., and she asked him for an autograph. ``She was spelling Kellye with a ye, and I thought, 'Umm, that's very pretty,''' Voldstad says in the July 2 issue of People magazine. Kellye's mom wasn't too keen about the romance and _ not trusting those Hollywood types _ went along on most of the couple's dates. Kellye, who wants to act, appeared on ``Newhart'' as an extra before the show went off the air. But it's love, not a career, she wanted from Voldstad, she says: ``I love John and he loves me, and if you can't see that you must be blind.'' As for their 19-year age difference: ``John's 25 mentally anyway,'' she shrugs.
