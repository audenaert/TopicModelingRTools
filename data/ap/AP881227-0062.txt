 The police chief arrested his brother on Christmas Day after he pulled the plug on the community's Christmas tree following a night of drinking. Chief Ralph August jailed his brother, Stephen, on public drunkenness and disorderly conduct charges after he disconnected the tree's lights, refused to go home, followed the chief to a convenience store and shouted obscenities. He later set fire to a jail mattress, the chief said. ``He wanted to take me outside and beat my head,'' the chief said. ``This is normal.'' The 41-year-old chief said it was the fourth time he has arrested his brother. ``My brother has a habit of not liking the law to tell him what to do,'' he said Monday. August, 37, a construction worker, spent the holiday in jail and was released Monday after pleading guilty to the charges, agreeing to pay court costs and a $300 fine and promising to paint the fire-damaged cell.
