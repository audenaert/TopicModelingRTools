 U.S. Postal inspectors arrested 10 employees for drug trafficking through the Dallas Main Post Office Tuesday night, following a nine-month undercover investigation. Postal Inspector Jim Travell said authorities are still looking for two more employees who were indicted for selling and distributing marijuana and cocaine at the postal processing center. ``The indictments were handed down by a Dallas grand jury and charged each postal worker with selling drugs to agents who worked in an undercover capacity at the facility,'' said Travell, of Fort Worth. Sealed indictments were handed down April 28, Travell said, but they were not unsealed until Tuesday to allow authorities time to organize the arrests. Those arrested are mail handlers or processors and distribution clerks who worked two evening shifts processing mail through the Dallas facility, Travell said. ``They worked different shifts and we have no reason to believe there was a conspiracy between them,'' Travell said. The employees, who have one to 10 years experience with the postal service, were arrested for selling between a quarter-ounce to several pounds of marijuana or between a half-gram to a quarter-ounce of cocaine in any one sale to the undercover officers, Travell said. ``The largest sale we did was $1,000,'' Travell said. ``Most of them ranged from $25 to $1,000 a sale. The jist of the investigation was dealers, not users.'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Webster of Dallas said the employees face pentalties of 5 years to 15 years in prison and fines of $150,000 to $200,000. Travell said inspectors were alerted to a drug trafficking problem among the 4,000 workers at the facility by employees. ``Fellow employees are starting to be fed-up with this type of behavior,'' Travell said.
