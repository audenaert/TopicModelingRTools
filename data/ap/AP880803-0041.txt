 Alf Saliba wants to make a point. Actually, the human dartboard wants to make several points _ in his chest. Saliba, a 49-year-old stuntman who calls himself ``The Incredible Alf,'' said he's had as many as 20 darts hurled into his chest. He announced today that he's now shooting for 50 darts, which he figures ought to be good enough for his primary target of gaining entry into the Guinness Book of World Records. Saliba makes his living by pushing skewers through his cheeks, threading hooks through the fleshy parts of his body and hanging bricks from them. He said he accomplishes these things _ without bleeding _ through concentration and meditation. The current record holder isn't exactly sitting on pins and needles waiting for the record to fall. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, there isn't a current record holder.
