 Dennis Day, the Irish tenor of radio and television fame, was sent home Monday from St. John's Hospital and Health Center, although he remains in critical condition, a hospital spokesman said. ``According to his physician, he was discharged because his care can be continued in a home setting,'' said Armen Markarian, a hospital spokesman. ``He's surrounded by his family there, and he'll be more comfortable in a home setting.'' Day was admitted to Saint John's on June 5, and continues to suffer from a recurrence of pressure on the brain, publicist Kitty Davis said. The 71-year-old singer was diagnosed last summer as suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressively degenerative nerve disorder also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. On March 9, Day suffered a head injury in a fall at his Bel Air home, and underwent emergency treatment to relieve the pressure caused by bleeding in the brain. He remained in the hospital until April 12, Markarian said. Day appeared regularly with comedian Jack Benny on radio and television as well as in films. Born Eugene Denis McNulty in New York, he assumed the name Dennis Day when he joined Benny's radio show as a singer in 1939 and quickly grew into a comic foil for the host.
