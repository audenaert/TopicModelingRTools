 The phrasing of a question and answer in a sex knowledge survey released Wednesday by the Kinsey Institute, and reported by The Associated Press, may have been misleading. The true-false question stated, ``There are over-the-counter spermicides people can buy at the drugstore that will kill the AIDS virus.'' The correct answer given was ``True.'' That does not mean the spermicides will cure AIDS, the Kinsey report says. Instead, many health care professionals say using the spermicides along with a condom may help protect against transmission of the AIDS virus during sexual intercourse, the report says. The spermicides include an ingredient called nonoxynol-9 that can kill the AIDS virus in the test tube, the report says. June Reinisch, director of the Kinsey Institute, said, ``It is very likely to work in people.''
