 A teen-ager who required 110 stitches after a shark attack in southeastern Australia said Friday that his surfing days are over. Murray Taylor, 15, said the ``huge shark'' dragged him from his surfboard and bit him repeatedly. Murray said he escaped by punching the shark on the nose and trying to gouge its eyes. The attack occurred Thursday at Moana Beach, 30 miles south of Adelaide. ``When he reached the shore he actually walked up the beach on his own,'' said Murray's mother, Wendy Richardson. ``Murray said he wasn't sure how big the shark was, but he said its head was at least a foot wide.'' The teen-ager was recuperating at Flinders Medical Center in Adelaide.
