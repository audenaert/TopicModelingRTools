 CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather told the University of Oklahoma's graduating seniors Saturday that if America is to reclaim the ideals that made it great, today's graduates must acknowledge that ``greed is out'' and ``achievement is in.'' ``You must leave here today with a commitment to contribute,'' said Rather, commencement speaker for Oklahoma's 96th graduation exercise. ``Find a life's work worthy of yourself and your heritage, commit yourself with all the zeal that you can muster and throw yourself into it.'' In Stillwater, the state's new higher education chancellor told Oklahoma State University's graduating seniors that research funds will provide the means by which the state will successfully adapt to the future. ``Money, money, money ... that is what is needed. And we should not be bashful about it,'' said Chancellor Hans Brisch.
