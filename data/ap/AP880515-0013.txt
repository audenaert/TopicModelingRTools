 A great white shark, one of the few known man-eaters, swam into a commercial fishing net in Southern California's coastal waters, a television station reported Saturday. The 13-foot, 1,500-pound shark was displayed when the vessel docked Saturday at Terminal Island in the Los Angeles harbor. Anthony Tibich, skipper of the Aggressor, had ventured out Friday on an overnight trip to San Clemente Island in search of commercially marketable shark, according to a report by KNBC-TV in Burbank. But the skipper was surprised to find tangled in the fishing net Friday morning the huge type of shark featured in the ``Jaws'' movies attacking surfers and swimmers, the report said. Sightings of the great white shark are unusual in Southern California's warmer coastal waters. San Clemente Island is about 75 miles southwest of Los Angeles. Reports of a great white shark sighting on Thursday led Orange County authorities to evacuate about 2,000 swimmers along a 5{-mile shore at Newport Beach. The beaches were reopened Friday.
