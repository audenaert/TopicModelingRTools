 Radio dispatcher Jani Kochever received a very special early morning call from Clark County Sheriff's Deputy Greg Chaney, known on the air as code number 140. ``Control 2, 140,'' Chaney said Tuesday. ``Personal request.'' ``Go ahead,'' replied Ms. Kochever, known on the radio as Control 2. ``Jani, will you marry me?'' Chaney asked. ``She sat there with her mouth open,'' said fellow dispatcher Pam Shurtliff. ``I almost answered for her. I was going to say, `Yeah, she'll marry you.''' When Ms. Kochever recovered, she replied, ``140, Control 2, absolutely I'll marry you. ``And then another deputy said, `You can't back out now, because we're all witnesses,''' the bride-to-be recalled. Ms. Kochever said she and Chaney had been dating about 10 months, but she had no hint he would make his graveyard-shift proposal. No wedding date has been set, but stay tuned.
