 Mayor Edward I. Koch said he stands by his criticism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson before New York's Democratic primary, but says he regrets that his belligerent style and sharply worded attacks offended Jackson's supporters. In a statement released hours after Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward called on the mayor to apologize for his ``divisive'' remarks, Koch said he had ``articulated my concerns in a way that, regrettably, offended a large number of people, both black and white.'' ``I would hope they will look beyond my style to the substance of what I said, which I believe was fair political criticism. ``The words I used were too sharp. These are words I have used for years. Because of the particular sensitivity of this situation, I should have been more careful in my choice of words.'' It was highly unusual for Ward _ the city's first black police commissioner and a Koch appointee _ to comment on political matters that did not directly involve the police department, but he said he felt the need to do so because he was being asked regularly about Koch's anti-Jackson efforts. In a letter that appeared in today's editions of The New York Times, Koch said, ``It was never my intent to draw political lines with racial or religious borders.'' Ward said today he was ``absolutely'' satisfied that the mayor never intended to insult the black community. Koch's attacks on Jackson have brought a continued backlash and have prompted early efforts to form a coalition to defeat the mayor next year, when it is expected he will seek a fourth term. When asked if Koch was apologizing to Jackson as well as his supporters, the mayor's press secretary, George Arzt, responded: ``Whatever the letter says. We're not going beyond it.''
