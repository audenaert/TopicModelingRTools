 Police in western Bangladesh opened fire on transport workers striking against alleged police harassment and 15 people were injured, according to news reports Sunday. The indefinite strike halted bus traffic in 16 districts and stranded thousands of bus passengers, the government-owned Dainik Bangla newspaper reported. Police and demonstrators clashed in Pabna, 75 miles northwest of Dhaka, the paper said, but it did not specify how many of the injured were protesters and how many were police. It also did not say how many were wounded by the gunfire. Police said they opened fire when the workers tried to storm an office of the road transport authority. On Saturday, 50 people were injured when pro-government workers and opposition-backed laborers clashed, using homemade bombs and knives, over the ouster of a union leader in Adamjee, 10 miles south of Dhaka, police said.
