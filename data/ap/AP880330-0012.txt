 President Reagan says former national security aides Oliver North and John Poindexter are not being presumed innocent on conspiracy, theft and fraud charges in the Iran-Contra scandal. ``Someplace along the line, many of us have forgotten that you are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Reagan told a group of regional reporters on Tuesday. ``What has happened, I think, in the case is it's just everyone is accepting guilt on the basis of accusation.'' North, Poindexter and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert A. Hakim pleaded innocent last week to charges that they defrauded the government of more than $17 million by diverting profits from the Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Although he once again spoke out on behalf of his indicted former aides, Reagan backed away somewhat on Tuesday from his assertion last week that North is still an American hero. Reagan said he was referring to the Marine's wartime record. ``I think I was too short in my remark when I answered the question,'' Reagan said. ``I should have augmented that and said why, and that is: Look at the record and at the honors and the medals that have been awarded him for bravery in combat,'' Reagan said. ``And I have to say those were heroic actions and he is a valid hero.'' North, who has announced he will retire from the Marine Corps in May, received a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts in the Vietnam War. He said after his indictment that he might attempt to subpoena the ``highest-ranking'' government officials to testify in his defense. Reagan declined to say on Tuesday whether he would testify on North's behalf.
