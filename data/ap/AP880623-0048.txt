 Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young says the city is moving along with preparations for next month's Democratic National Convention despite criticism of ``chaos and confusion'' in the convention planning. ``I don't know what (they're) talking about in terms of confusion and chaos,'' Young said on Wednesday. ``Peace and quiet and tranquility and everybody getting along is not news, and that's what we got.'' Young was responding to recent news articles that reported bad judgment calls by convention planners working on space for convention sessions and hotel accommodations. The articles also said some major transportation routes are still under construction and convention planners have been fighting among themselves. ``I don't care what people say about Atlanta. Anybody who doesn't like Atlanta can go somewhere else,'' Young said. ``This is a building and growing city and it will be for some years to come, but whatever we need for the convention is going to be ready by the time the convention gets here.'' Young estimated the city is about ``85 to 90 percent ready'' for the convention, a condition with which he is ``very comfortable.''
