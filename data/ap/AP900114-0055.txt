 The Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers earned a trip to the Super Bowl on Sunday behind superb passing performances by quarterbacks John Elway and Joe Montana, who wrote his name in the all-time NFL record book. Behind an almost-flawless Montana, the 49ers beat their NFC West-rival Los Angeles Rams 30-3 for the NFC championship in San Francisco and a chance at becoming the first repeat Super Bowl winner in a decade. Montana, who passed for 156 yards in a 21-point second quarter that broke the game open, had a 20-yard TD pass to Brent Jones and an 18-yarder to John Taylor, his 30th and 31st in postseason. That broke the record of 30 by Pittsburgh's Terry Bradshaw and sent the Niners on to New Orleans, where in two weeks they will be trying to match another standard set by Bradshaw and the Steelers with their fourth Super Bowl victory. Pittsburgh was the last team to win two straight Super Bowls, in 1979 and 1980. In Denver, the Broncos earned their fourth shot at the Super Bowl with a 37-21 victory over the Cleveland Browns, whom they've beaten three times in the AFC championship since 1987. Elway enjoyed his best game of the season and his best ever in the playoffs, completing 20 of 36 passes for 385 yards and three touchdowns. He took Denver on scoring drives of 82, 80, 80 and 60 yards.
