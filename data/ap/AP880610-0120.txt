 Some 33,000 pounds of refuse was carted away from a house after it was declared unfit for human habitation, the city's environmental health director said. That was 9,000 pounds more garbage than was generated in the entire city after last October's World Series celebration, said the director, Frank Staffenson. It took seven truckloads to remove the refuse. Cleanup was completed Wednesday when the last of the garbage was removed, rodent traps were placed inside, and the house was boarded up. ``As it stands now the house is condemned as unfit for human habitation and will remain so until the repairs are made and the utilities turned back on,'' said Staffenson. The house's owners, Michael and Deborah Eggert, have not been available for comment. The couple's four children, who lived in the house, have been placed in foster care.
