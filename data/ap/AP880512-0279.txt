 RJR Nabisco Inc. announced it has formed a new company, Del Monte Foods, to combine the operations of its worldwide Del Monte operations and other portions of Nabisco Brands Inc. The new company will be headquartered in Coral Gables, Fla., and will stand as a separate major operating unit of RJR Nabisco, the Atlanta-based consumer products giant said Wednesday.. RJR Nabisco Vice Chairman Robert J. Carbonell, who is also chairman of the American Trade Consortium, will serve as chairman and chief executive officer of Del Monte Foods. ``Through Del Monte Foods, RJR Nabisco will be positioned to fully leverage the value of the Del Monte name as a global brand, covering both fresh fruit and processed fruits and vegetables,'' Carbonell said. The consolidation also will allow the company to increase its presence in Latin American countries, he said.. Del Monte Foods will provide management for four operating divisions: Del Monte Tropical Fruit Company; Del Monte Foods USA; Del Monte Foods Latin America; and Del Monte Foods Europe. The operations of the combined division had 1987 sales of about $2.5 billion and net income of about $1.3 million. Del Monte Foods' worldwide operations include food processing facilities in the United Sates, central and South America, the United Kingdom, Europe and Africa. Del Monte Tropical Fruit has production operations in Cameroon, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Hawaii, Kenya and the Philippines.
