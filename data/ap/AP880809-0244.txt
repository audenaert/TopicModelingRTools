 The dollar advanced strongly on domestic and foreign markets Tuesday after the Federal Reserve surprised traders by increasing its discount rate. Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $426.90 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $430.20 late Monday. ``Raising rates in the face of a strong dollar probably was not expected,'' said Rick Gomes, a vice president at Irving Trust Co. Traders had not expected the Fed to increase the discount rate, the fee the central bank charges for short-term loans to member banks, because the dollar has been strong, Gomes said. Investors bought the dollar because higher interest rates make it more valuable. Gomes said it was possible the major industrial countries known as the Group of Seven _ the United States is one _ were putting their monetary policies ahead of their currencies. Gomes said there were rumors in the market that West Germany, Japan and other G-7 countries might follow the Fed's lead and increase their own interest rates. But Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust & Co. in Chicago, said foreign interest rate hikes would not stop the dollar's upswing. ``The only thing to put a cap on the dollar would be central bank selling,'' he said. Johnson called the Fed move confirmation of the economy's strength. The Fed's board voted unanimously to increase the disount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. The increase, which took effect immediately, was the first change in the rate since Sept. 4 and put the rate at its highest in more than two years. An increase in the discount rate is the central bank's most direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb on economic growth. Economists have been concerned in recent months that continuing economic growth could spark a new round of inflation, partly because of the country's low unemployment, high production levels and the Midwestern drought. In Tokyo, before the Fed announcement, the dollar fell 0.39 Japanese yen to a closing 133.58 yen. In late London trading, after news of the discount rate hike, the dollar rose to 134.25 yen and in New York, it climbed to 135.15 yen from 133.725 yen late Monday. In London, the British pound fell sharply against the dollar. It cost $1.6830 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7022 late Monday. Sterling also dropped against the dollar in New York, closing at $1.6840, compared with late Monday's $1.7005. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.9204 West German marks, up from 1.90005; 1.6065 Swiss francs, up from 1.5883; 6.4710 French francs, up from 6.4115; 1,413.475 Italian lire, up from 1,402.00; and 1.2160 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2110.
