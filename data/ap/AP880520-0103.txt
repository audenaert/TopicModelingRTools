 Former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin has been found guilty of using cocaine after being jailed for failing to appear at his trial. Detroit Recorder's Court Judge John O'Brien ruled Thursday there wasn't enough evidence to convict Ruffin of a cocaine possession charge, but did find him guilty of using the drug. Ruffin faces up to a year in jail at his sentencing, scheduled for May 31. The singer was being held in Wayne County Jail pending a hearing on his failure to appear earlier this week. He failed to appear for court dates Monday and Tuesday morning and was arrested on a bench warrant when he showed up in Recorder's Court late Tuesday. Ruffin, 47, originally was charged with possessing a trace of cocaine after a July 28, 1987, raid on a friend's home. A co-defendant testified that he and Ruffin were among seven people who pitched in to buy 42 grams of crack cocaine. Ruffin, who lives near Detroit in South Lyon, said he went to the house to find a friend, not to buy drugs. But he admitted Thursday that he had used cocaine recently after O'Brien threatened to force him to take a drug test. Ruffin, who turned down an offer to plead guilty to a lesser charge, sang with the Temptations, a top Motown group, from 1963 to 1968. He has recently been performing with another former Temptation, Eddie Kendricks.
