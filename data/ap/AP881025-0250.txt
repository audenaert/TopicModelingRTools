Analysts are quick to note that two different markets currently are functioning _ one that involves takeover and buyout issues and another that involves the remaining equities untouched by either actual deals or speculation. ``The deal market can erupt anytime'' and propel the Dow Jones average higher, noted Larry Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``All it takes is one announcement of another mega-deal and it's off to the races,'' he said, referring to recent billion-dollar bids for RJR Nabisco, Pillsbury, Kraft, West Point-Pepperell and Chicago Pacific. The rest of the market, however, is not awash with excitement. ``The broad market looks tired and overbought,'' Wachtel said. Some analysts believe the broader market is due for some consolidation.
