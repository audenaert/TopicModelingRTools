 Axl Rose, lead singer of Guns N' Roses, was arrested Tuesday for allegedly hitting a neighbor woman over the head with a wine bottle during an argument about loud music, authorities said. Rose's neighbor Gabriela Kantor accused Rose of grabbing her keys and tossing them off a balcony before emptying a wine bottle and swinging it at her, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom. Rose was arrested and booked for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon. His business manager posted the $5,000 bail, said Deputy Bill Linnemeyer and arraignment was set for Nov. 20. Kantor was taken to a hospital for observation and released. In a statement, Rose denied both striking the woman and playing music loudly. Rose met with attorneys Tuesday to discuss whether to file a complaint seeking an injunction against Ms. Kantor, said Bryn Bridenthal, a spokeswoman for his record company, Geffen Records. ``He's been having problems with this woman for the past eight months,'' Bridenthal said. In an earlier incident, deputies went to Rose's apartment Aug. 1 to ask him to turn down his stereo. Rose later filed a complaint saying one deputy forced his way into the apartment while others tried to provoke him. Critics of the Los Angeles-based Guns N' Roses band have called the band's lyrics homophobic and racist. The band gained notoriety earlier this year after an obscenity-laced acceptance speech for a music award on live television.
