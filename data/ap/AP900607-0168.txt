 South Korean President Roh Tae-woo left Honolulu Thursday afternoon for Seoul as he wound up his historic trip to the United States. On Monday, Roh held groundbreaking talks with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in San Francisco. Then, he flew to Washington to brief President Bush on the talks aimed at reducing tensions between North and South Korea. Roh spent about 18 hours in Hawaii relaxing from his high-level diplomatic contacts with the two superpower leaders. About 100 men, women and children from Hawaii's Korean community were on hand at Hickam Air Force Base for Roh's departure. Many of the women were dressed in hanboks, traditional Korean dresses.
