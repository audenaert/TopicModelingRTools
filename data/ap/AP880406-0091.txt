 Alan Paton, the country's best known author, was recovering today from surgery for an undisclosed ailment, a press report said. Paton, whose 1948 novel ``Cry, The Beloved Country'' drew a compelling picture of South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation, was in ``fairly serious condition'' after Tuesday's operation, according to an unidentified heart surgeon quoted by the South African Press Association. A spokeswoman at St. Augustine's Hospital in Durban said today that Paton was in stable condition. The 85-year-old novelist underwent surgery after being admitted to the Durban hospital Monday, the news agency said. Paton's ``Cry, The Beloved Country'' is the second best-selling book ever in South Africa after the Bible. Paton worked in anti-apartheid politics for many years with the United Party and still contributes political commentary to South African newspapers. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
