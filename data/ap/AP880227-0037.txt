 A 36-year-old East German man fled uninjured over the heavily fortified border to West Germany by climbing fences under cover of darkness, border police said. The man crossed the frontier late Thursday near the West German community of Philippsthal, 90 miles northeast of Frankfurt, said border police in Kassel. The escapee was not identified. At least 17 people have fled over East Germany's border with West Germany and the Communist-constructed Berlin Wall since Jan. 1, according to West German officials.
