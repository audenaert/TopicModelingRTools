 Equipped with a gun, a nightstick and a regulation-size teddy bear, police officers in this town boast they're ready for any emergency. The idea of driving around with stuffed animals may not inspire a new television series _ ``T.J. Teddy''? _ but Tewksbury police officers are receptive to the the idea if it means helping children deal with traumatic events. ``When you've got a little kid who has been in an accident and who is hysterical, it's a good idea,'' said Officer Donald Ryan. However, he added, the bears ``will stay in the trunk.'' The town's 13 police cars are equipped with two regulation, 7-inch teddy bears apiece. Police say the bears' first week on duty already has produced positive results. ``It calms the kids down a lot and creates a good feeling towards the police, too,'' said Deputy Police Chief Denise Rosen. ``A lieutenant gave one to a child of a mother being interviewed concerning some domestic problems at her house.'' The bears were donated to the force by the New England Telephone Pioneers, a charitable group whose members are current and retired phone company employees. The police department calls the group when a bear is given to a child so it can be replaced.
