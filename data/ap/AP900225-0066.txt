 To hear some people tell it, there is money to burn in this trendy seaside community, but it still isn't every day that a bank tosses $42,500 into the trash. ``We're sort of embarrassed,'' Great American Bank spokesman Brian Luscomb said Friday, a day after the windfall was recovered from a municipal trash truck that had hauled it away. ``It was an accident and we're really not commenting much beyond that,'' said Luscomb, who added that a bank employee whose name wasn't released put the money in the wrong container. When the garbage truck got to the dump, officials there had been warned about the missing cash, and they had the driver take his load to a city yard instead. The garbage was dumped there and municipal employees dug through the trash until they found the cash. The city's trash collectors must try to track down the owners of expensive items but can keep lesser ones, said General Services Director David Niederhaus.
