 One new poll suggests Vice President George Bush is running neck-and-neck with Gov. Michael Dukakis, while another survey indicates the Republican nominee-to-be is only slightly behind his Democratic rival. The new results contrast with a series of surveys in recent weeks indicating Bush trailed Dukakis in double digits. A telephone survey of 1,013 adults last week by ABC News and Money Magazine, released Wednesday, found 45 percent support for Dukakis and 42 percent for Bush. That amounts to a tie, given the margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. And a Gallup poll of 1,210 voters, also out Wednesday, suggested Dukakis had the support of 46 percent, to 41 percent for Bush. The margin of error was 3 percentage points. By contrast, Gallup, NBC News-Wall Street Journal and Washington Post polls conducted since June 9 have found double-digit leads for Dukakis. The Post survey, done June 15-19, found a 51-39 percent Dukakis margin. The ABC-Money Magazine poll, conducted June 22-25, found support for Dukakis down 7 points from an ABC-Post poll in mid-May that used the same methodology. Bush rose only from 41 to 42 percent support; those who didn't know grew from 2 percent to 6 percent. The rest said they wouldn't vote or would support someone else. Poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as Dukakis came off the crest of his Democratic primary victories. A Harris survey early this month found a dead heat _ 49-44, with a 3-point margin of error _ and a USA Today-CNN poll gave Dukakis a single-digit lead. The ABC-Money Magazine poll had Dukakis leading among women, respondents earning less than $25,000 a year and adults aged 35 to 54. Bush led among men, respondents earning more than $50,000 and those in the 55-64 age group.
