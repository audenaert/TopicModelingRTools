 The script called for President Fernando Collor de Mello to set fire to a pile of seized cocaine and marijuana to promote his anti-drug campaign, but it didn't work out that way. Instead, TV viewers saw the gas-soaked pile of drugs explode in flames as Collor dropped a torch onto it, and the president cover his face and run back. Fortunately, the heat only singed Collor's right ear, hair and forearm, and he was not seriously hurt, the government news agency said Wednesday. Federal police chief Romeu Tuma said the explosion occurred at a ranch in remote western Brazil on Tuesday because ``the wind shifted.'' The ranch is in the Pantanal region, a transit point for illegal drugs near Brazil's border with Bolivia.
