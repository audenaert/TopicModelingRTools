 About 2,000 Soviet Jews are arriving in Israel daily, setting a record pace that could push the number of immigrants from all countries to more than 200,000 this year, officials and news reports said Thursday. On Thursday, 2,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants poured into Israel, surpassing last weekend's high rate of 1,500 a day, said Yehuda Weinrab, a spokesman for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency. The organization helps resettle immigrants. Israeli officials have attributed the surge this month to increasing uncertainty about the political climate in the Soviet Union and better Israeli-sponsored transportation arrangements. Israel army radio said the latest surge likely would push the overall December immigration total to 35,000 and the year-end figure to 205,000. The totals include Ethiopians and other nationals, but Soviets make up about 90 percent. About 1 million Soviets are expected by the end of 1992. While Israeli officials encourage the immigration, it is causing major housing shortages and unemployment problems.
