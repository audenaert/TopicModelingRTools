 State Sen. Greg Tarver was shot and wounded Saturday night, but refused to press charges after identifying the attacker as his wife, police said. The shooting happened at Tarver's home less than an hour after he returned from a special session of the Legislature in Baton Rouge. Police learned of the shooting when Tarver's mother phoned to report it, said Police Chief Charles Gruber. Tarver, 41, a senator since 1984 and one of only a handful of blacks in the 39-member body, was taken to LSU Medical Center, Gruber said. Hospital spokeswoman Elaine King said he was in stable condition, and a doctor said he was taken into surgery. Gruber said Tarver was shot once in the upper chest with a small caliber weapon about 6:45 p.m. ``He has identified his assailant as his wife, Sabrina,'' said Gruber, who disclosed no motive at a hospital news conference. ``There are no charges being filed at this time,'' Gruber said. ``She is not in custody at this time. We are not looking for her at this time. ``Sen. Tarver requested that we not pursue anything at the moment,'' he said, adding that police would pursue an investigation in case Tarver changed his mind about pressing charges. Gruber would not say where Mrs. Tarver was, and there was no answer at the Tarver home. Dr. Darryl Williams, dean of the LSU Medical School, said Tarver was taken into surgery. And, though he wouldn't speculate on the risk, Williams added: ``Any injury in that area can be life-threatening.'' Several of Tarver's legislative colleagues and one of Gov. Buddy Roemer's aides went to the hospital soon after he was shot.
