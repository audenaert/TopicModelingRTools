 A proposed bypass road in eastern England has caused a battle between conservationists who want to save the habitat of a rare moth and people who want heavy traffic diverted from their village. Six hundred residents from the village of Dersingham marched 1{ miles on Monday to Queen Elizabeth II's Sandringham estate in Norfolk to demand that work begin on the bypass, which they first called for 25 years ago. After pressure from conservationists, environment secretary Nicholas Ridley said he would consider revoking planning permission for the bypass, which would cut through a bog on the royal estate that is home to the moth. A group called the Nature Conservancy Council said the road could wipe out the moth, Choristoneura Lafauryana, by destroying the bog where it breeds. But the demonstrators doubt there are any moths left. ``A big survey by the Nature Conservancy Council led to nothing _ they couldn't even find the damn moth,'' said one marcher, James Crowe.
