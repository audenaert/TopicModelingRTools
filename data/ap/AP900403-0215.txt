 The original stars of the London production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical ``Aspects of Love'' will recreate their roles in the Broadway production opening April 8 at the Broadhurst Theater. The two American actresses, Ann Crumb and Kathleen Rowe McAllen, and two British actors, Michael Ball and Kevin Colson, are part of an ongoing exchange between American and British Actors' Equity. Directed by Trevor Nunn, ``Aspects of Love'' originally opened in London's West End on April 17, 1989, where it continues to play to capacity houses. Set in France in the 1950s and based on David Garnett's novel, ``Aspects of Love'' traces the course, over 18 years, of a romance between a young English boy and a penniless French actress, through an affair that involves all those whose lives it touches.
