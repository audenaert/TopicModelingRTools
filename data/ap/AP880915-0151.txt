 The fans who still buy Elvis Presley souvenirs now can pay for them with a flashy black credit card bearing the singer's image. ``Give your autograph to Elvis. ... Become part of the legend,'' says a brochure advertising the Presley MasterCard. Applications were sent to 200,000 people around the country this week, and Jack Soden, manager of Presley' former residence in Memphis, said more than a million will be mailed over the next couple of months. Soden said the MasterCard is being issued by Leader Federal Savings and Loan of Memphis. The non-profit Elvis Presley Memorial Foundation will get half the $36 annual fee for the MasterCard, and a portion of the 17.88 percent interest applied to card balances also will go to the foundation, Soden said. He declined to say what portion of the interest charges will go to the foundation or to estimate how much money the card will generate. The foundation was set up in 1985 by executors of Presley's estate but it has had little operating income, he said. The singer died in 1977. Income from the credit card will support programs in music education, for medical care for the underprivileged and for assistance to the homeless, Soden said. The Elvis credit card has a black background with a drawing of Presley in a singing pose with a guitar in his hands. The drawing is surrounded by red and gold lights from a jukebox. ``The card is absolutely gorgeous,'' Soden said. More than 600,000 tourists and fans visit Graceland each year and the Graceland complex, which includes a 36,000-square-foot shopping center, takes in some $9 million a year. The estate is run for the financial benefit of Presley's only child, Lisa Marie Presley.
