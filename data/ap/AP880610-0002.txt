 The editor of a leading African magazine has publicly apologized to Kenyan Moslems for an article alleging Arabs introduced homosexuality together with the Islamic faith to Kenya. ``It has been pointed out to the publishers of the magazine that it is sacrilege to say that the practice of homosexuality is in any way linked to Islam,'' Benjamin G. Bundeh said in a statement published in Nairobi newspapers Thursday. The article, which appeared in June's issue of the monthly True Love magazine, alleged that homosexuality is widely practiced for money at the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa and other resort towns along the coast. Moslem leaders and politicians in Mombasa reacted angrily to the report as soon as the magazine hit the newsstands on June 2. ``Such reports are malicious and calculated to create disunity and hatred between Christians and Moslems in the country,'' said Said Hemed, a member of Parliament and an ethnic Arab. True Love is published in Nairobi, the capital, by Drum Publications and bills itself as Africa's leading magazine. Arabs settled along the Kenyan coast more than 500 years ago.
