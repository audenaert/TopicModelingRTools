 Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Thursday it had agreed to sell Midland International, an electronics division of Western Auto Supply Co., to Glenayre Electronics Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada, for $35 million. Sears acquired Western Auto, a Kansas City-based auto-parts and hardware chain, earlier this year for about $400 million. The Midland sale was subject to a definitive agreement being reached. Midland is a major supplier of equipment for the wireless communications industry with facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, Sears stated. Midland is a significant supplier of land mobile radios and associated equipment to Glenayre, according to L. Claude Simmonds, Glenayre's chairman and chief executive. Midland's senior management will remain in place, Simmonds said.
