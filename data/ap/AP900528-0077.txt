 Kilauea Volcano destroyed the 153rd home of its seven-year eruption Monday and threatened at least two others in this lava-ravaged Hawaii Island community, authorities said. A house located north of the Kalapana Store and Drive-In and Mauna Kea Congregational Church burned at 6 a.m., Hawaii County civil defense spokesman Bruce Butts said. He said the half-mile-wide flow continued to move erratically. It was filling low spots in what remains of Kalapana and was not moving toward the ocean. At last report, lava was within 25 yards of the closest home.
