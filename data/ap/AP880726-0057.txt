 The body of a man found shot four times in the head has been identified as that of a former Texas schoolteacher wanted on kidnapping and drug smuggling charges, police say. Juan Francisco ``Frank'' Garcia, 38, his head wrapped in a gauze bandage and his hands tied behind his back, was found dead in the back seat of an abandoned car shortly after midnight Saturday, said Hernan Guajardo, state judicial police director. Guajardo said the body was identified through fingerprints sent from federal authorities in Texas. The body was found by municipal police in Guadalupe, a suburb of Monterrey. In a news conference Monday, Guajardo described Garcia as a ``person dedicated to narcotics trafficking on a grand scale.'' He said Garcia had been sought in the United States since the early 1980s. Garcia taught elementary history in the Donna Independent School District for two years in the early 1970s. He also taught migrant students in Edinburg, Texas, according to records kept by the Edinburg Daily Review newspaper. Garcia failed to appear in Hidalgo County Court in Edinburg in 1984 on a charge of kidnapping. The case involved the abduction of a South Texas couple taken to Dallas and tortured in an attempt to find more than $500,000 in gold coins Garcia believed had been taken from him, according to the Daily Review. Garcia also is wanted on a federal indictment in Houston in 1985 charging him with involvement in a narcotics smuggling ring. That so-called ``Cash Crop'' indictment alleged that Garcia and 43 other people were involved in smuggling about 250,000 pounds of marijuana from Mexico into the United States.
