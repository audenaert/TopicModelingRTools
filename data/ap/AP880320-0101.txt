 American soldiers practiced military maneuvers Sunday on a Honduran airstrip just 21 miles from the Nicaraguan border, but U.S. officials said the threat from Sandinista troops had subsided and combat appeared unlikely. Nicaragua formally protested a Honduran bombing raid on Sandinista positions Saturday as an unwarranted act of aggression. It has denied that its troops crossed the jungle-choked border dividing the nations.
