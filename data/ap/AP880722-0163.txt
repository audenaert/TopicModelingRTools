 The leaders of Greek and Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus will meet in New York next month for talks aimed at resolving problems in the divided nation, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said today. U.N. officials said Georges Vassiliou, president of the Republic of Cyprus, and Rauf Denktash, president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, will visit New York for talks Aug. 24. ``The leaders of the two sides in Cyprus have accepted my proposal for resumption of talks to negotiate a settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus problem,'' Perez de Cuellar said in a brief news conference. He did not elaborate on his proposals for peace in Cyprus, which has been divided since Turkish troops invaded in 1974 and captured the northern third of the island. Turkish Cypriots, who comprise one-fifth of the island's 650,000 people, have formed their own breakaway state, headed by Denktash, in the Turkish- controlled territory. Several rounds of talks between Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders, under U.N. mediation, have failed to resolve disputes over the form of a federation and withdrawal of about 29,000 Turkish troops.
