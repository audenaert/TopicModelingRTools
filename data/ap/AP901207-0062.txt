 The judge who set bail at $300,000 for the alleged killer of Rabbi Meir Kahane suspended it a day later, and the district attorney said the original motion granting bail was made over his objections. State Supreme Court Justice Alvin Schlesinger, who approved the $300,000 bail for El Sayyid Nosair on Wednesday, suspended it on Thursday and scheduled a new bail hearing for Monday. District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Thursday that his office had requested Nosair be held without bail. ``We pointed out to the court that he is accused of committing a number of exceptionally serious crimes, including both the murder of Rabbi Kahane and the wounding of a federal police officer,'' Morgenthau said. Nosair, 35, of Cliffside Park, N.J., is accused of shooting the Zionist activist last month as Kahane finished a speech at a New York City hotel. He also is accused of wounding two other men as he fled. One of the two, a postal service police officer, wounded Nosair. In a statement to police, attached to a disclosure form filed in court, Nosair told police Kahane was actually shot by another person and that he was framed. He said he went to hear Kahane's lecture because he agreed with much of the rabbi's philosophy.
