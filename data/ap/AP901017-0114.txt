 Republican gubernatorial candidate Pierre Rinfret claims his report of a 1977 trip to the Middle East prompted Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's historic peace mission to Israel. Cyrus Vance, U.S. Secretary of State at the time, on Wednesday called Rinfret's claim ``rubbish.'' Rinfret is challenging Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo's bid for a third four-year term. A recent independent poll found Cuomo had a 45-point lead. Rinfret's August 1977 report, titled ``The Geopolitics of Israel and Surrounding Arab States,'' discussed Israel's military preparedness in case of war The report said Israel would try to destroy the economic base of each enemy country and would target the Suez Canal, electric power stations, factories and dams. Rinfret, an international economic consultant, said Israeli secret service officials told him that the disclosure of Israel's military intent convinced Sadat to visit Israel, according to campaign spokesman Ted Kavanau. Sadat's surprise visit to Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in November 1977 led to the historic Camp David peace accord between Egypt and Israel two years later. ``The Israeli secret service took the report and gave it to Sadat,'' Kavanau said. ``When he got it - this is Pierre Rinfret talking - he made the decision instantly to go to Israel. ``The Israelis were using Rinfret to deliver a message to the Egyptians that they would fight,'' Kavanau said. Vance said Sadat decided to visit Israel on his own. ``I was in very close touch with Sadat all along and Rinfret was never mentioned,'' said Vance, a New York City attorney who served during the Carter administration. Sadat and Begin shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978. Sadat was assassinated by Moslem extremists in 1981. Begin, 77, resigned as Israeli prime minister in 1983.
