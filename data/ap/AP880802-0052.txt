 Pat Robertson has completed his journey from religious broadcaster to presidential candidate and back, returning to the Christian Broadcasting Network as co-host of ``The 700 Club.'' ``For better or worse, the health of this ministry depends on this program. It is our bread and butter,'' Robertson said Monday after the first broadcast of the revamped program, which included the introduction of a new co-host, Sheila Walsh, a gospel singer and songwriter from Scotland. Robertson, who founded CBN, left the network in 1986 to pursue his political goals. In 1987, when the Southern Baptist minister formally announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, he installed his son, Tim Robertson, as president of CBN and one of three hosts of the program. During that period, donations dwindled. CBN officials blamed the decline on scandals in other television ministries, changes in ``The 700 Club'' format and a poor economy in oil states where many CBN donors live. Robertson later said his absence was the reason for the drop. During that time, CBN laid off more than 1,000 employees _ about half its workforce _ and cut its operating budget by more than 40 percent. Ratings for ``The 700 Club'' also dropped, giving rise to the format unveiled Monday. Gone were the dramatic recreations of religious conversions and the public prayers for healing that marked the old program. Robertson said the new formula for the 90-minute program will be one-third news, one-third ministry and teaching and one-third lifestyle features. Robertson still plans to campaign for Vice President George Bush during the presidential election. ``When I leave that desk,'' he said, pointing to the studio desk from which he delivers the news and commentary segment of the program, ``I am no longer a newsman. When I'm there, I will try to report the news fairly.''
