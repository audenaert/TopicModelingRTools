 Drug and alcohol tests were administered to 18 staff and school board members at Homewood-Flossmoor High School, and now it is the student athletes' turn. A lottery will select 15 athletes a week, starting this week, to be tested for alcohol and 10 drugs. Two of the samples will be checked for steroids. During the semester a total of 277 athletes will undergo screening in the school district south of Chicago. Football coach John Wrenn said the program already is working. ``Through the grapevine I've heard that some students have gotten help,'' Wrenn said. ``That's what this program is for, not to punish kids, but to get them help.'' Athletic director Ken Schultz submitted the first urine specimen Friday followed by the principal, Charles Smith, and 16 other administrators and school board members. The testing will cost $40,000 to $50,000, school officials said. It will be paid for through donations and increased ticket prices for football and basketball games. Athletes who fail the test will be evaluated by a drug conselor and will be suspended from school for 30 days if considered chemically dependent. They will be reinstated if they follow a treatment plan and pass a new test, but could be suspended for up to a year if they fail the follow-up test.
