 A couple accused of taking a premature baby from a hospital were arrested after they showed off the infant to relatives who became suspicious and called police, authorities said. Sharon and Robert Newkirk were arrested Saturday on charges of kidnapping 2{-month-old Debra Lynn Moore on Friday evening from her crib at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor. They were to be arraigned later today. The Newkirks on Friday took a child to the home of Robert Newkirk's sister and brother-in-law, Judy and Gerald Edmundson. ``Robert was so excited,'' Judy Edmundson said. ``He held her and said, `Daddy loves you.''' But in retrospect, ``We had a funny feeling about it,'' Gerald Edmundson said. ``The next day, we heard the report on the news that a baby had been kidnapped. We put two and two together.'' Police picked up the Newkirks as they pulled into the driveway of their home in Howell, about 20 miles away. Police said they found the baby in the couple's car. The baby was returned to C.S. Mott, where her twin brother also is a patient, and was listed in good condition. Police Sgt. Jim Tieman said authorities did not know a motive for the abduction.
