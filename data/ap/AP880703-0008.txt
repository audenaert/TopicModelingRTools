 A policeman who was supposed to be dead turned up alive and was arrested along with his wife and son after they tried to collect $5,400 in benefits, the United News of India said Sunday. The news agency reported that Constable Ganesh Singh, from the town of Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh state, went on leave two weeks before his retirement June 1. A few days later, his son told authorities Singh had died of a heart attack. A sum of 70,000 rupees, about $5,400, was granted to the constable's family because the man died in service. But before his family was able to cash in, a police officer spotted Singh strolling around the Balaghat railway station. The constable confessed he, his wife and son had plotted his ``death'' because benefits for a policeman dying in service were higher than normal retirement pensions.
