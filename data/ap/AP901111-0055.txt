 A group of prominent Algerians announced plans Sunday to hold a tribunal next month against President Bush on charges including crimes against humanity. The group said it plans to hold the proceedings in the Algerian capital, Algiers, on Dec. 10. Foremost among the charges will be ``threatening peace and world security by his preparation for an aggressive war against Iraq,'' the group said in a communique. The Algerian tribunal will be headed by Ali Ammar Louar, former president of Algeria's bar association. It will be made up of academics, lawyers and intellectuals active in human rights, the group said. The tribunal is apparently not sponsored by the Algerian government. It would have no way of enforcing its sentence. In its statement, the group said the U.S.-led economic blockade of Iraq is a crime under ``terms of the international convention for prevention of and punishment for genocide.'' The sanctions, approved by the United Nations, were imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
