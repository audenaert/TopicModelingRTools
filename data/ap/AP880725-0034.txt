 An out of control stock car flew through a fence and into the bleachers during a race, killing one spectator and injuring 13 others, authorities said. The driver, who estimated he was traveling at 50 mph, was able to walk away from Sunday's crash at Lakeside Speedway. The car, which landed in an open space between the guard rails and the grandstands after tearing through a chain link fence, ``looked like it had gone through a compactor,'' said Lakeside police Sgt. Bob Wall. Those injured were sitting in the front row, said spectator Mike Garrison of Thornton. Another race driver, Don Cash, said he was about five lengths behind the car driven by Gary Burton when Burton lost control. ``He hit the wall and got airborne,'' said Cash. ``I looked again and it (the car) just went around like a helicopter.'' Burton, 22, got out and walked away after the crash, Cash said. Burton was taken to a hospital shaken but uninjured, authorities said. Burton said the track was slick. ``The car got loose and tagged the guardrail. I got a little too close to the guardrail,'' said Burton. Kristy Carlson, 26, of suburban Arvada, was pronounced dead at St. Anthony Hospital late Sunday, said spokesman Randy Shook. Twelve others were injured and taken to hospitals, but only a 4-year-old girl with a broken arm and head injuries was admitted for observation. The accident occurred midway through the 25-lap main event on the fifth-mile paved oval, Cash said. Lakeside is a tiny incorporated town between Denver and Wheat Ridge with a population of about 15 residents.
