 Albanian border guards shot at Albanians trying to flee to Yugoslavia on makeshift rafts, killing at least four of them and wounding others, the Croatian news agency HINA reported. It quoted Yugoslav police as saying Albanians used rafts made of tractor tires and rubber inner tubes to flee to neighboring Yugoslavia across the Bojana river; that 23 men, women and children crossed safely, but that four bodies were found on one raft and a number of refugees were reported wounded. HINA, reporting from the Yugoslav border town of Ulcinj, said Albanian border guards began shooting at the rafts at about 1 a.m. Thursday. A group of 28 Albanians successfully crossed at the same place Tuesday.
