 A former lawmaker from Italy's neo-fascist party was formally charged on Wednesday in connection with a train bombing that killed 16 people and wounded 266 in 1984. Massimo Abbatangelo, who served in the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Social Movement from 1979 to 1987, was charged with causing a massacre, joining an armed band, bombing with terrorist and subversive ends, and possession of explosives. He was detained in Naples on Oct. 10 after a year as a fugitive, but the formal arrest warrant and charges were filed Wednesday by investigative magistrate Claudio Lo Curto. Nine other people are on trial for the bombing in Florence. The bomb exploded Dec. 23, 1984, on an express train traveling between Naples and Milan. Authorities say the bombing was carried out by right-wing terrorists and the Mafia in an attempt to destabilize the country.
