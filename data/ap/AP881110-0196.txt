 The International Monetary Fund announced today that it is granting the west African republic of Ghana a loan of $497 million under its new, easier terms for the poorest countries. Interest will be at only 0.5 percent, instead of the usual 6 to 7 percent or more, and there will be a 5 1@2 year grace period during which only interest need be paid. Ghana will get 10 years to repay the principal. It will get the new money in six semi-annual disbursements, which can be suspended if Ghana fails to meet agreed conditions. Ghana already owes the fund $628 million. The fund did not announce the details of its conditions, but said the government of Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings has undertaken to speed up ``structural reforms.'' It added that the government is also trying to help the country's poorest and most vulnerable groups.
