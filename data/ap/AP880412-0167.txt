 Cher completed her transformation from pop singer to top actress at the 60th Annual Academy Awards when she won the Oscar for her role as the superstitious young widow of ``Moonstruck.'' ``I want to really say something,'' she said when she accepted the award Monday night. ``When I was little my mother said, `I want you to be something.''' ``I don't think that this means that I am somebody, but I guess I'm on my way,'' Cher said. She was nominated by the Academy once before for ``Silkwood.'' Cher, known for her outrageous garb at past Oscars, was slightly subdued this time in a black sequined gown with see-through netting and strategically placed spangles. Backstage, she said of her getup: ``I think Theda Bara would probably be proud of me,'' referring to the famed ``vamp'' of the silent screen.
