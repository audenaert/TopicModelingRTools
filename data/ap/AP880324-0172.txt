 The former Armed Forces Radio disc jockey portrayed by Robin Williams in the hit movie ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' says Hollywood distorted his original idea for a screenplay and his life. ``No, I did not try to meet girls on street corners. No, I did not teach American slang to the Vietnamese. No, I was not thrown out of Vietnam and to my knowledge, no Vietnamese friends of mine were Viet Cong,'' Adrian Cronauer told students Wednesday at Mississippi State University. But he praised Williams' performance, which has been nominated for an Academy Award. Cronauer, 49, a law student at the University of Pennslyvania, bellowed ``Goooood Mooooorning, Vietnam'' at the beginning of his popular ``Dawn Buster'' 1965 Saigon radio show. His trademark sign-on was adopted by succeeding Saigon DJs, including ``Wheel Of Fortune'' host Pat Sajak.
