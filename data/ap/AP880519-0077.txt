 A judge banned an 18-year-old robbery suspect from riding the city's train system, calling the youth ``a menace'' to transit patrons. ``He's forfeited his right to use that form of public transportation. He can use the public sidewalk,'' Cook County Circuit Judge Michael Bolan declared Wednesday when Tommy Holloway appeared for the second consecutive day on charges he had robbed a train passenger. On Tuesday, Bolan found probable cause to charge Holloway with robbery for the theft of a gold necklace and $38 from a 16-year-old student riding an elevated train on April 22. Less than two hours after leaving court on $5,000 bond in that case, prosecutors contend, Holloway stole a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap and a book bag from another student waiting for a train. During that attack, Holloway and nine other youths punched and kicked the victim on the ground, said Assistant State's Attorney Mary Lou Norwell. Bolan on Wednesday set bond at $50,000 for each case. He didn't say how he would enforce that banning order. ``You're leading a marauding little pack of dogs out there,'' Bolan told the defendant. ``If I could hold you without bond, I would because you're a danger to the community _ a menace.''
