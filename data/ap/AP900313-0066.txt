 Here are major elements of President Bush's aid package for Nicaragua and Panama. OVERALL FUNDS. Bush coupled a $300 million aid package to help Nicaragua speed the transition to democracy with a renewed request for $500 million in aid to Panama. He requested the Panama money earlier this year, but it got sidetracked in Congress on other issues. The Nicaragua and Panama money would be diverted from unspecified Pentagon programs. An existing $21 million would be used for emergency aid to Nicaragua, including food. Some of it would be used to help re-integrate the Contra rebels. TRADE. The president lifted a five-year-old trade embargo against Nicaragua. He also took steps to allow Nicaragua to resume shipping sugar to the United States and to make that nation eligible for duty-free treatment for a variety of other products. SUPPLIES. Some $60 million would be earmarked for providing critical agricultural supplies, petroleum and medical supplies. EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS. $10 million would help pay for ``emergency employment programs,'' including ones designed to help turn soliders into farmers. RESETTLEMENT. Some $45 million would go toward helping speed the repatriation and resettlement of the U.S.-backed Contra forces and other refugees, and an additional $1 million would be used for technical assistance in restructuring the economy. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE. Some $50 million would be used to help Nicaragua pay off debt to the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. An additional $75 million would go toward helping to prop up the Nicaraguan currency to help restructure the economy and aid the country with its balance-of-payments imbalance. PROJECTS. About $60 million would help pay for such projects as bridge, road and highay repair and refurbishing schools and hospitals. FURTHER AID. Bush said he would later propose an additional $200 million to be used in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, with details to be announced later
