 Four hunger strikers, who lost a total of 151 pounds protesting the U.S. training of Salvadoran soldiers, ended their 35-day fast Sunday after doctors warned of permanent health damage. ``Our cause continues,'' said the Rev. Roy Bourgeois, a Roman Catholic priest from Lutcher, La., after the strikers ended their fast at a morning news conference. ``The bread we received today is nourishment for us to recommit ourselves.'' Bourgeois was among nine protesters who began the fast Sept. 3, praying, carrying signs and marching outside Fort Benning. The group demanded that the United States cut all military aid to El Salvador and stop training Salvadoran soldiers at the base's Army School of the Americas. The United States is spending some $315 million in aid to El Salvador this year, much of it economic and food aid for an economy racked by a decade-old civil war with leftist guerrillas. A Democratic task force has pressed the Bush administration for restrictions in next year's planned $85 million in military aid to the country in wake of investigations into the slayings of six Jesuit priests in the capital of San Salvador in November 1989. Five of the original protesters dropped the fast over the last two weeks. Remaining were Bourgeois; Jim Barnett, a Dominican priest who served in El Salvador and plans to return now; Charlie Liteky of Washington, D.C., who won a Medal of Honor by pulling 20 wounded men from under enemy fire during the Vietnam War; and David Scott, an ex-Marine and Vietnam veteran from Detroit. Bourgeois said the four decided to end the strike after doctors warned that their weight loss could cause permanent health damage. He said Liteky was warned he could sustain severe kidney damage. Bourgeois said he lost 38 pounds, Liteky 40, Scott 35 and Barnett 38.
