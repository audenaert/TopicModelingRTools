 Winter wheat planted last fall for harvest this summer is in ``mostly good to fair'' condition in some of the nation's major production areas, a government report said Tuesday. The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said wheat during the week of Feb. 29 through March 6 was not quite in such good shape in the northern Great Plains, Delta and Rocky Mountain states, however. ``Snow cover was virtually nonexistent in the central and northern Great Plain and Rocky Mountain states, but mild temperatures kept damage at a minimum,'' the report said. ``Snow, preceding freezing temperatures, prevented severe winter damage to small grain (including wheat) in eastern Kansas, northern Oklahoma, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana and Ohio.'' Crop development by early March ranged from greening in Colorado to jointing of plants in Mississippi and Oklahoma, and heading in Arizona, the report said. The facility is operated by the departments of Commerce and Agriculture. Reports do not forecast actual production of crops, only the condition of fields and plants.
