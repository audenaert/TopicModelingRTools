 A peace activist broke a 63-day liquid-only fast _ one day for each million dollars allegedly spent on ``Rambo III'' _ by biting into a giant pizza with a pepperoni peace sign and delivering it to Sylvester Stallone's door. Jerry Rubin, a Southern California campaigner against cinema violence and war toys, didn't see Stallone but was more graciously received Saturday than in a previous visit to a Stallone residence when someone squirted him with water over a wall. The actor's housekeeper even obliged when Rubin needed to do a retake of his stunt for TV cameras. Rubin's wife, Marissa, and two friends were on hand as the activist went to Stallone's home and, with media watching, presented the pizza to a housekeeper. When a television crew arrived late, Rubin went back to the door and got his pizza back to re-enact the event. At one point, the unwieldy, 3-foot-wide pizza slipped off its cardboard platter and onto the concrete driveway. After his first bite in 63 days, Rubin said he was looking forward ``to watching movies with popcorn again.'' One of the placards carried by the group read, ``Sly, Give Pizza A Chance.'' Rubin said he hoped his attempt at humor would open a line of communication with Stallone and other makers of violent films. ``We need to reach them to open up that dialogue because it has gotten out of hand,'' he said. ``In 10 or 20 years from now we're going to pay a sad price, because these films not only have a negative effect on children but they have a negative effect on everyone.''
