 with Michael Dukakis by saying one of his daughters works for the Democratic nominee but assured viewers: ``She doesn't tell me what questions to ask, I don't tell her how to run the governor's campaign.'' Koppel, host of ABC's ``Nightline'' program, ended his 90-minute interview with the Massachusetts governor Tuesday night br telling viewers he had a ``small housekeeping note.'' He said his daughter, Deidre, works for the Dukakis campaign. ``It was a choice that she made on her own after she graduated from college,'' Koppel said. ``I can tell you without having to worry about shading the truth in any fashion, she doesn't tell me what questions to ask, I don't tell her how to run the governor's campaign, and let that be the end of it.'' Miss Koppel has worked in several areas of the campaign, including the press staff in North Carolina and also in the campaign's Boston headquarters.
