 Grape stompers can cast off their shoes and squish for charity at Stone Hill Winery. For the 13th year, the winery is sponsoring a Grape Stomp on Saturday to raise money for a workshop for the disabled, and hundreds of contestants were expected to have a go. Last year, the event raised $1,900. Contestants paying a $3 entry fee get 30 pounds of red grapes and two minutes to show their stomping style, said Betty Held, co-owner of the 143-year-old winery. ``They will be stomping to the music of Otto's Polka Band from St. Louis,'' she said Thursday. ``The judges will grade them 80 percent on the amount of juice the stomping produces and 20 percent on their style.'' Age groups for contestants range from pre-teen to over 55. The best stompers will get prizes, and all contestants may keep the juice from their efforts. Hermann is on the Missouri River about 60 miles west of St. Louis.
