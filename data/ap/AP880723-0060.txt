 Johnny Carson, poking fun at Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton for the 35-minute speech that had Democratic conventioneers shouting and snoozing, invited him to appear on his ``Tonight Show.'' ``It would be great,'' Carson told his studio audience Friday night. ``We won't have to book any other guests.'' Carson said Clinton had been invited to appear on his late-night show next week. The governor's press secretary, Mike Gauldin, said in Little Rock that the invitation had been received, but didn't know if Clinton had accepted. Clinton's speech Wednesday night nominating Michael Dukakis for the Democratic presidential nomination was widely panned for its length _ Clinton had been allotted 15 minutes _ and its content, which many described as boring. In his monologue, Carson said the 5-foot-7 Dukakis looked taller when he delivered his acceptance speech Thursday ``because he was standing on a transcript of Gov. Bill Clinton's speech. ``It's kind of a sad footnote. Clinton's speech is still going on. Because of the greenhouse effect, it's still trapped in Atlanta,'' Carson said. Jackie Speer, an Arkansas State Police trooper assigned to the Governor's Mansion, said he believed Clinton was asleep when Carson's monologue began, and said the governor was not available for comment. When he returned to Little Rock on Friday, Clinton told reporters, ``Everybody knows I can make a speech. Now everyone knows I can blow one.''
