 Britain last year basked in its warmest`weather since records were first kept 330 years`ago, the Meteorological Office said today. The mean temperature in central England rose to 51.2 degrees in 1989, breaking the previous record of 50.9 degrees set in 1949. Meteorological Office spokesman Barry Parker said last year was the sunniest since 1909 and the driest`since 1976. ``While the maximum temperatures were not as high as 1976, the summer many of us remember with glee, the weather was consistent all the way through the year,'' Parker said, adding that April was the only month considered very cold. The government's records, compiled since 1659, show the winter of 1989 was the 20th century's warmest, the spring ranked 10th warmest`and the summer and fall were the seventh warmest this centuryn The mean temperature indexl which takes a sampling of weather stations`in central England, is considered the most reliable national weather guide. Earlier this year, the London Weather`Center announced that 1989 was the sunniest this century. The center said the capitol sizzled in 839.5 hours`of sunshine in May, June and July.
