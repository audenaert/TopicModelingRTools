 Michael Dukakis accused Republican George Bush today of campaigning with ``a warmed-over call to selfishness'' and said a Democratic White House would seek prosperity for all Americans, not just the wealthy. The Democratic presidential nominee said Bush does not understand that GOP economic policies have not spread their benefits across the economy but had served people who already have good jobs _ or inherited wealth. ``But most Americans aren't satisfied, and neither am I,'' the Massachusetts governor told an invitation-only campaign rally. In a line borrowed from John F. Kennedy, Dukakis said he means ``to get America moving again,'' restoring strength to all parts of the economy and all sections of the nation. He said the next president will face ``a sea of Republican red ink that not even Moses could part.'' In his prepared speech, Dukakis said federal resources are limited but problems cannot be shrugged away. ``And we can't afford leadership that says over and over again that it's morning in America and then suggests that all we Americans have to do is roll over and go back to sleep,'' he said. Dukakis said Bush is the candidate of a complacent party that ``seems to have exhausted its reservoir of ideas'' for dealing with the economy. ``In their hearts they know that four more years of Reaganomics would be bad for the country, and that four more years of Reaganomics without Reagan would be a disaster.''
