 A storm that moved across the Midwest today dumped more snow in Kansas and Missouri and threatened a winter redux in the Northeast. Snowfall accumulation early today had reached as much as 8 inches in northern Missouri and 7 inches in parts of central Kansas. Light snow also fell today south of Indianapolis, in southwestern Pennsyvania and in Cincinnati and Louisville, Ky. The storm front threatening southern Ohio was expected to bring up to 5 inches of snow overnight to West Virginia and between 2 and 4 inches to Philadelphia. Snow also was expected today in New York, New England and portions of South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa. Elsewhere, unseasonably warm temperatures were expected to extend across the Southwest, and thunderstorms were to scatter over the southern Plains. Forecasters predicted highs today in the 80s and 90s in the Southwest and Florida, and in the 40s and 50s across much of the nation's midsection. Thunderstorms produced inch-thick hail near the Oklahoma towns of Mountain Park and Meers on Friday. In the Florida Panhandle, some of an estimated 2,500 evacuees began moving back to their flood-damaged homes on Friday as swollen rivers began receding. The flooding stemmed from torrential rains in Alabama and Georgia a week ago. The nation's high Friday was 97 degrees at Borrego Springs, Calif.
