 More than 40 firefighters worked all day to remove the bodies of four children and three adults killed in a fire that engulfed a house. The fire quickly burned out of control around before dawn Wednesday and causd the roof and floor to fall into the basement, making it difficult to reach the bodies, said Fire Chief Victor Hilbert. The cause of the fire wasn't known. A neighbor who called the Fire Department said it was impossible to get close enough to attempt a rescue. ``It was all in flames when I came out. The windows were popping out,'' said Larry Riker. Killed were David Forquer; his wife, LeAnne, 25; their children, Michael, 8; Christor, 6; Nona, 5; and Louis, 3, and a man whose identity was not released.
