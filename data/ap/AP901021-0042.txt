 A former day care center employee has been sentenced to 10 years' probation for spiking an infant's formula with rubbing alcohol because she was angry at co-workers. Patricia Ann Escarenio, 21, pleaded guilty to injury to a child in connection with the April 24 incident and was sentenced Friday by State District Judge Mike Wilkinson. She also was fined $5,000. The 4-month-old boy who drank the formula was hospitalized but authorities said he suffered no lasting effects because he vomited the concoction. Assistant District Attorney Carol Davies said authorities believe Ms. Escarenio was angered at the boy's mother, her co-worker at Chuckles & Grins day care center, because of a job assignment that day. Later that day, Ms. Escarenio checked herself into the psychiatric unit of St. Joseph Hospital and admitted tainting the bottle, Ms. Davies said.
