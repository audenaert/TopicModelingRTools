 Opposition leaders and Communist officials have tentatively set national elections for June, government television reported. ``According to unofficial information, the first round of (parliamentary) elections should take place on June 8,'' Czechoslovak TV said Thursday. The report came as the Communists, other political parties and the opposition Civic Forum met to review procedures for the elections and the status of independent political parties. ``The draft elections law is aimed at having the elections for the Federal Assembly and both National Councils (parliament) first ... and in the second half of the year the elections to the lower levels of representative bodies should take place,'' the television said. The 35O-member Czechoslovak Parliament is so far dominated by Communists. The discussions are expected to produce a solution to balancing its membership to reflect the current political situation. The talks are being attended by all five political parties existing before the revolution and the loosely organized opposition group, Civic Forum. About 20 new political parties have been created in Czechoslovakia the past two months, but none is represented at the current talks. The peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia led to the ouster of Communist party chief Milos Jakes and his hard-line colleagues in late November. Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel became president last month.
