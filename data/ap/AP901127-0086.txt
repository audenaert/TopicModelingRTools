 Students serenaded Barbara Bush with a Spanish version of ``America the Beautiful'' during her tour Tuesday of a local school and community center. Mrs. Bush visited a DIF center, one of a network in Mexico under the patronage of first lady Cecilia Occelli de Salinas that includes adult education, handicraft training to make items for home sale, a garden and a food kitchen for the elderly. A children's orchestra began playing ``The Yellow Rose of Texas'' as Mrs. Bush passed through the school. ``Oh, oh, there's my song,'' she exclaimed. ``They're playing my song.'' Mrs. Salinas hosted the event. Also on hand were Diana Negroponte, wife of U.S. Ambassador to Mexico John Dimitri Negroponte; Nickie Bennett, wife of Monterrey's U.S. Consul General John Bennett; Alma Rizzo, wife of Monterrey Mayor Socrates Rizzo, and Cristina Trevino, wife of Nuevo Leon Gov. Jorge Trevino. Mrs. Bush wore a light blue silk suit with thin horizontal white stripes and her trademark pearls while Mrs. Salinas wore a teal and black linen dress. Mrs. Bush was presented with a basket of handicrafts made at the training center by 9-year-old Jesus Eduardo Gonzalez Jimenez, who admitted beforehand that he did not know who she was. At the nearby school she was serenaded by students singing ``America the Beautiful,'' ``Cielito Lindo,'' and ``La Bamba.'' She also was given medals and a heart-shaped pecan arrangment with her picture in the middle.
