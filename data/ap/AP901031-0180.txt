 A hunter was charged Wednesday with accidentally killing a man he mistook for a turkey. Game wardens said the victim, Charles Boyer, was crouching near some bushes and calling turkeys when he was shot in the forehead. Boyer wore clothes with blue-gray parches that resemebled turkey heads, said Lorraine Yocum, a law enforcement supervisor for the state Game Commission. Troy Alan Moore, hunting with a separate party about 90 yards away, saw blue-gray spots moving and fired at them, grazing Boyer above the right eyebrow, Ms. Yocum said. Boyer, 43, of New Galilee, lost a lot of blood during the 40 minutes it took paramedics to get to the remote spot on a timber company's property in Deerfield Township, she said. He died shortly after they arrived. Moore, 24, of Tidioute, was booked on a misdemeanor charge of killing a human being while hunting with a firearm. Arraignment was set for Nov. 16. Moore faces a fine of up to $5,000 and a 10-year revocation of his hunting license if convicted. Unlike deer hunters, turkey hunters in the state aren't required to wear bright orange because it alerts the birds, Ms. Yocum said. Since Pennsylvania's small-game season opened Saturday, three people have died in turkey hunting accidents, the Game Commission said. A man who in 1988 shot a woman he mistook for a deer was acquitted earlier this month by a Superior Court jury in Bangor, Maine.
