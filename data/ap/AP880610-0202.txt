 High school officials who protested greeting cards linking drinking and graduation are irate and embarrassed over a similar display in their school's yearbook. The full-page photo spread in Edison High School's yearbook, the Oracle, shows students with beer bottles and wine coolers. It appeared less than a week after Edison administrators joined in a protest of the Hallmark cards, which the company later said it would discontinue. ``I'm very concerned and disappointed,'' Principal Jack Kennedy said Thursday. ``If there was a way I could recall it, I would. But I can't. ``It depicts everything we're against,'' he said. Edison officials became involved in the protest after a parent discovered two cards linking drinking to graduation fun. The parent, who is on a committee planning a graduation party next week at Edison, took the cards to Mothers Against Drunk Drivers. Kennedy is retiring July 1 and will be replaced by Brian Garland, who also joined members of MADD in the June 3 protest outside Hallmark's regional sales office in Newport Beach. Garland said Thursday that the photo page in the yearbook showed ``poor judgment'' and gives the school a bad image. ``It won't happen again,'' Garland said, ``I won't tolerate it. You can bet the farm.'' Students paid for the page, near the back of the annual, school officials said. Jim Wheeler, a 19-year yearbook adviser, said he was unsure ``where to draw the line'' but added the yearbook staff had voted to refrain from such features next year.
