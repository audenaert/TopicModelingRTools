 Gov. Robert D. Orr said he has narrowed his list of candidates for Vice President-elect Dan Quayle's U.S. Senate seat to eight finalists. Orr said Friday that expects to name his selection sometime this week. A final background check of the finalists was being conducted over the weekend. The Indianapolis Star, in its Sunday editions, said Orr confirmed a list finalists that the paper had learned from sources. The eight, all Republicans, are U.S. Reps. Dan Coats and Dan Burton; former Indiana Secretary of State Edwin J. Simcox; state House Speaker Paul S. Mannweiler of Indianapolis; state Rep. Patrick J. Kiely of Anderson, chairman of the state House Ways and Means Committee; Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz; Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut; and Marion County Prosecutor Stephen Goldsmith, the newspaper said. Orr told the newspaper Friday he had reduced a group of 50 candidates for the Senate seat down to 20 to 25 names and then down to the eight finalists. He said that the finalists who are from the Indianapolis area, such as Hudnut and Goldsmith, have a slight disadvantage compared with the other candidates because Indiana's other senator, Richard Lugar, is from there.
