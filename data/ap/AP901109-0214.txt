 Share prices ended slightly higher on London's Stock Exchange Friday after a lackluster session. Share prices picked up small gains in early trading as investors took advantage of Thursday's sharp decline to pick up some bargains. But as soon as the buying dried up the market drifted lower, failing to gain support from Wall Street's performance. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 4.4 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,040.6 at the close. The Financial Times 30-share index rose 7.7 points to close at 1,582.6. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 1.15 points to close at 1,085.87. Volume was 370.1 million shares compared with 423.1 million shares Friday.
