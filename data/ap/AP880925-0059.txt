 And of course, as far as the _ how we make it better _ yes, we can do better on interdiction, but we've got to do a lot better on inter _ we've got to do a lot better on education. And we have to do _ be tougher on those who commit crimes. We've got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole culture. You know, I saw a movie, ``Crocodile Dundee.'' And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident. And it's bad. Everybody ought to be in this thing _ entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education. And it isn't a Republican or Democrat or a liberal problem, but we have got to instill values in these young people. And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States in terms of doing better on interdiction, and in terms of doing better in the neighborhoods. But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is: values in the schools.
