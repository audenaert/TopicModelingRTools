 A magazine Monday berated the British for their dress and manners, saying European neighbors regard them as the slobs of the continent. ``We go out without combing our hair, wear the same shoes two days running and throw rubbish out of our car windows,'' complained ``She,'' a monthly women's magazine. It said other Europeans consider British men ill-mannered and chided British women for dressing badly and shouting at their children in public. If the British want to join the ``nouveau European'' elite, the magazine said, their manners, attitudes, habits and appearance all need ``a complete overhaul.'' Tips offered by the magazine include never leaving home unless groomed immaculately, remembering to wish everyone good morning, afternoon or evening, and walking with ``dignity and grace.'' Other guidelines: spending more on personal appearance, displaying family loyalty, drinking more mineral water and never eating junk food in the street.
