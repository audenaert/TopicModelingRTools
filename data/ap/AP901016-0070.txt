 JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP - A fire destroyed a two-story frame house near downtown, killing six people, and six counts of murder were filed today against the husband of one of the victims. The fire was reported late Monday by a police officer who spotted the blaze while on routine patrol, Police Lt. Lorin Mock said. By the time firefighters arrived, the house was fully involved in flames, he said. The man arrested, whose name was being withheld by police, also was charged with setting the fire that killed his wife, another woman, and four children, three girls and a boy, said police spokesman Asa Higgs, who offered no other details. He also was charged with violating an injunction ordering him to stay away from his wife, Higgs said. Investigators did not say how the blaze was started. A man sleeping in a car outside the house was able to save a 3-year-old boy, Mock said.
