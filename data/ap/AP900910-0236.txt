 Woody Allen has added his next three pictures to his exclusive agreement with Orion Pictures Corp. as writer, director and producer. He will star in two of the three. Principal photography was recently completed on Allen's ``Alice,'' which will be released by Orion this fall. Also starring in ``Alice'' are Alec Baldwin, Blythe Danner, Judy Davis, William Hurt and Cybill Shepherd. The fall will also see the start of the last film under the existing agreement. The movie, as yet untitled, stars Allen and Mia Farrow.
