 A flight to Baltimore from San Juan, Puerto Rico, was diverted to Miami after passengers wrongly accused a fellow traveler of carrying a gun, an airline official said Monday. Passengers on American Airlines Flight 704 Sunday night told flight attendants that a man was ``acting a little strange,'' and that he had a gun in his briefcase, said Tim Smith, a spokesman at American's Dallas headquarters. ``The flight attendants then alerted the plane's captain, who decided to divert the plane to Miami'' shortly before 9 p.m., Smith said. ``The man was met by Dade County authorities who searched him and his baggage and found nothing.'' The man, who was not identified, spent the night in Miami and was rescheduled onto a flight to Baltimore Monday morning, Smith said. The airplane refueled during a 30-minute stop in Miami, then continued on to Baltimore's Washington International Airport, he said.
