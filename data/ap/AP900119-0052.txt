 Efforts to establish a monument to the Free Speech Movement are meeting resistance from the same quarters on the University of California that opposed the movement to begin with. A coalition of faculty members has suggested a commemorative piece of artwork in Sproul Plaza, the location of many rallies by the student movement that helped kick off years of protest around the country. The initial 1964 protest concerned administration rules limiting political activity on campus. Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman said in a letter to faculty Thursday that he opposes the monument. ``I am troubled,'' Heyman said, ``in our establishing a monument in celebration of a movement which is viewed by many in the community with negative or mixed emotions.'' A group of faculty members conducted a nationwide design competition that attracted more than 1,000 entries. ``I think once we come up with a brilliant piece of art, there's no reason to believe it will not be passed,'' said professor Peter Seltz, former director of the UC Art Museum and chair of the Berkeley Art Project.
