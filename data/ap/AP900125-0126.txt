 A woman is suing a school district for locking her 13-year-old son in a cafeteria closet for three school days for fighting. Frances Allison said her son, Gary DeWayne Morris, has nightmares and refuses to sleep without a light since the incident last March. She is suing the Elmore City School district and a former principal for $100,000. The lawsuit, filed in December, says the boy was kept in the 4-by-5-foot closet from 8:25 a.m. to 2:45 p.m., that meals were served to him and that he had to urinate in a bottle. ``Imagine what they would have done to me if someone had come to my house and noticed Gary in the closet,'' Ms. Allison said. ``They'd put me in jail and take away my kids.'' Delbert Handke, district superintendent, said today that the boy was allowed out to use the bathroom. He said the incident occurred before he became superintendent. The school district said Ms. Allison consented to an in-house suspension. Ms. Allison said the principal told her such a suspension would occur in a classroom away from other students and would be supervised by a teacher.
