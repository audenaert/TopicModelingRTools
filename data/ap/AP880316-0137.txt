 A man convicted of buying LSD with $20,000 he received from a state fund for crime victims has been sentenced to four years in prison and fined $14,000, federal court officials said Wednesday. James B. Miller, 29, of South Charleston, pleaded guilty in January to two counts of distributing the hallucinogenic drug, admitting he sold 3,300 ``hits'' of LSD to police agents in 1986. He appeared Tuesday before U.S. District Judge John T. Copenhaver Jr. Compensation fund records show Miller was awarded the maximum personal-injury payment of $20,000 in 1985 after he was shot in 1983. Miller apparently had just arrived at a beach party when he was shot in the right arm by someone using a .30-caliber rifle, police records show. Miller lost his arm and incurred about $38,000 in medical bills, according to state officials. State officials said the crime victims' fund now can pay claims directly to hospitals.
