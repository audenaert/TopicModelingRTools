 Diana Lewis works for the Police Department, but her truck has been forced into a life of crime. Her silver 1979 truck was stolen in early July and again this week from the same bus parking lot. Both times, police say, the truck was apparently used as a getaway vehicle by the same man to rob two banks. Enough's enough, says Ms. Lewis, who has transferred to a new police job and won't park her truck in the lot any more. ``The odds of becoming a victim around here seem to be getting smaller,'' said Ms. Lewis, a civilian employee for the detective bureau and a part-time reserve officer. Ms. Lewis found the abandoned truck herself after it was used in a July 6 robbery. Officers found it a few hours after it was used in a bank robbery Wednesday. If the last robbery wasn't enough, it also got a paint job. A dye package planted in the stolen cash exploded inside the truck's cab, painting it red.
