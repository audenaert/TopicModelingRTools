 Evan Bayh was elected the nation's youngest governor, but his sweeping Democratic victory did not prevent the home state of another youthful candidate, Sen. Dan Quayle, from falling solidly behind George Bush. Bayh, the 32-year-old secretary of state and son of former Sen. Birch Bayh, defeated two-term Republican Lt. Gov. John Mutz on Tuesday to end 20 years of Republican control of the governorship. Two-term Republican Sen. Richard Lugar also was re-elected by 1,407,568 votes, or 68 percent, to Democrat Jack Wickes' 671,527 votes, or 32 percent, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting. Bayh tallied 1,124,163 votes, or 53 percent, and Mutz had 994,359 votes, or 47 percent. GOP Gov. Robert D. Orr, 70, had been barred from seeking a third term. ``I'm feeling a whole lot older right now,'' said Bayh, who when he is inaugurated on Jan. 9 will be the nation's youngest governor at 33. ``It's been a long campaign.'' Mutz, a 53-year-old veteran of Hoosier politics, admitted he was taking the defeat hard, saying he was ``too old to cry and it hurts too much to laugh.'' In the presidential race, Vice President Bush, a Republican, had 1,281,940 votes, or 60 percent, to Democratic Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' 848,931 votes, or 40 percent. The victory gave Bush 12 electoral votes. Indiana voters also repealed the state's 137-year-old constitutional ban on lotteries. In House races, Indiana Democrats managed to protect their 6-4 advantage over Republicans as all incumbents won.
