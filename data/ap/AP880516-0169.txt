 A teen-ager told his mother, ``I'm a Crip and nobody messes with me,'' just before she stabbed him to death during an argument over less than $100, police said Monday. The killing was one of five gang-linked deaths over the weekend despite 125 arrests by a 200-officer anti-gang task force. The deaths pushed last week's countywide gang-related death toll to 10, and increased the 1988 total to 123. Sammie McGee, 37, told police she stabbed her son, Bluefus Davis, 18, in the heart with a steak knife Saturday night after an argument over money loaned him on Mother's Day, said police Sgt. Jon Rygh. Ms. McGee remained in custody on Monday, booked for investigation of murder, said Detective Steven Hooks. He confirmed her son's statement about being a member of the Crips, a notorious Los Angeles street gang. The amount of money the two were arguing over ``is varying back and forth, depending on who we talk to,'' Hooks said. ``It was probably under $100 and over $50. There is no exact amount.'' Hooks said Davis did not live with his mother. ``From the indications we have, he just pretty much came over and started arguing,'' said Hooks. Detectives were still trying Monday to find out what the loan was about. ``We're still trying to sort through it. It's not a clear cut case,'' he said. Prosecutors ave until Wednesday to decide whether to file charges. ``You get mad enough to think you want to kill your kids, but to actually do it _ that's something else,'' said police Sgt. Alfonso Rodriguez. ``She nailed him,'' Rodrugues said. ``It wasn't just to scare him _ somebody will do that when they're mad, scratch his arm or something. But this was once right in the vital area.''
