 Stock prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Monday, while the dollar edged up. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 80.06-point winner Friday, lost 130.24 points, or 0.46 percent, to close at 28,079.18. The dollar closed at 133.88 yen, up 0.48 yen from the last week's close after moving between 133.80 yen and 133.95 yen. Trading was moderate on the stock exchange's first section, with volume at 600 million shares. Exchange dealers said the yen-dollar rate was not likely to change much for the moment because if the U.S. currency touches the 134-yen level, investors are likely to sell the dollar.
