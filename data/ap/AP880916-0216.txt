 A Findlay man sitting in a downtown restaurant was arrested Friday after someone allegedly overheard him making threatening remarks against Vice President George Bush, police said. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, campaigned in the northwest Ohio city Friday morning. Police said Charles T. Rode Jr., 35, allegedly made threatening comments about 9 a.m., shortly before Bush's arrival. Police and Secret Service agents arrested Rode, who did not resist and was not carrying a weapon, police said. He was held until Bush left the city and then was taken to the Lucas County jail in Toledo, where he was being held without bond Friday night on a charge of threatening the vice president.
