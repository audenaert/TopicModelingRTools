 The European Community expressed concern Monday about the dangers of a catastrophic famine in East Africa. ``The council (of ministers) stressed the very real danger that the present drought, combined with a persistent difficult political situation, will lead to famine on a catastrophic scale'' in East Africa, the final communique read. The council of ministers said substantial short-term emergency food supplies will be necessary in the next few months. It said the United Nations has estimated that in Sudan as many as 5 million people are at risk. The council urged coordination of help among donors and called on all EC member nations to make their people aware of the seriousness of the situation, including ``the Community's concern about destuuction of refugee camps.'' Lynda Chalker, British minister for development, said the situation is even worse than the drought of 1984-85. She said there was evidence the government in Sudan was covering up cases of malnutrition.
