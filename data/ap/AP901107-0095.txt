 Lawton Chiles' coattails failed to help son Ed Chiles win a seat in the Florida Senate. Lawton Chiles was elected governor, but his son lost in Senate District 24 on the state's southwest coast to businessman John McKay. ``I feel like a winner,'' said Ed Chiles, like his father, a Democrat. ``I just don't feel like a loser.'' He said he was pleased with the 48 percent of the vote he received in the heavily Republican district. Ed Chiles, a restaurant owner from Holmes Beach, said he may not be coming to Tallahassee as a senator, but plans to visit the governor's mansion. ---
