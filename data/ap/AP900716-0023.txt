 A dancer for the rap group Heavy D & The Boyz died after falling 30 feet during horseplay at an arena, authorities said. Troy Dixon, 22, whose stage name is Trouble T-Roy, died Sunday evening of of injuries suffered in the fall, said officials at Wishard Hospital. Police said Dixon was standing on the third-level ramp at the Market Square Arena late Saturday when another group member, while fooling around, rolled a trash barrel down the ramp toward him. Dixon jumped on a 4-foot retaining wall to avoid the barrel and fell over backward to the ground, police said. ``It was an absolute freaky accident,'' said group manager Carol Kirkendaul. The Rev. Charles R. Williams, president of Indiana Black Expo, said the group had performed at the arena earlier Saturday as part of the Black Expo. The group, from Mount Vernon, N.Y., was on a 10-city tour and was one of the headline acts for Black Expo, which also featured the rap group Public Enemy. Kirkendaul said the group is in shock, and an upcoming concert in Detroit had been postponed. Heavy D & The Boyz won a Soul Train Music Award and a NAACP Image Award for their album ``Big Tyme.''
