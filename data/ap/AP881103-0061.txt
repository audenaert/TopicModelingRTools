 A classics professor who received Ohio State University's highest teaching award plunged 12 stories to his death from a parking garage in an apparent suicide, police said. John Vaughn, 41, taught a class in mythology that attracted hundreds of students and sometimes had a waiting list. A parking attendant saw Vaughn pacing the top floor of the garage Wednesday and approached to see if he needed help, said manager Charles Bruns. Without a word, Vaughn took off his coat, sat on a ledge and fell backward, the attendant reported. Vaughn received an alumni award for distinguished teaching in 1981, one of eight professors so honored that year, university spokesman Steve Sterrett said. Franklin County Coroner William Adrion tentatively ruled the death a suicide.
