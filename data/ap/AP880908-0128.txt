 Four white supremacists have pleaded guilty to federal charges they plotted bombings, robberies and other crimes to further their beliefs. The two Coeur d'Alene couples entered the pleas Wednesday night after reaching a plea agreement with prosecutors. The couples, David and Deborah Dorr and Edward and Olive Hawley, were scheduled to go on trial Monday. The Feb. 12 indictment accused them of committing a series of crimes in the Coeur d'Alene area in August and September 1986 aimed at advancing their white-supremacist group, Bruder Schweigen Strike Force II, or Order II. Besides raising money to finance its operations, the group sought to kill or intimidate opponents of their offshoot of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian-Aryan Nations, prosecutors said. They were accused of bombing an auto restoration shop, the home of a priest who was a leader in anti-hate group activity, and the federal building Coeur d'Alene. Prosecutors alleged the explosions were part of an aborted plan to rob a bank and a National Guard armory. All four pleaded guilty to racketeering or engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise from 1984 to 1987. Some also pleaded guilty to firearms or explosives charges or counterfeiting. Ryan approved an agreement with prosecutors that Dorr be sentenced to no more than 20 years in prison, Mrs. Dorr to no more than eight years, Hawley to no more than 12 years and Mrs. Hawley no more than a suspended six-year term. He scheduled sentencing for Oct. 26. A fifth defendant, Robert Pires, has pleaded guilty to charges including a 1986 slaying and bombings and attempted bombings in Coeur d'Alene. Pires was sentenced to 25 years in prison and has been cooperating with prosecutors.
