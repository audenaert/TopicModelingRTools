 Fitzhugh Green, a retired government official and biographer of President Bush, died of heart problems Wednesday at age 72. He died at Newport Hospital in Rhode Island. After more than 25 years in the federal government, Green resigned in 1970 to run for Congress from Rhode Island as a Republican. After losing, he returned to Washington, working for the Environmental Protection Agency from 1971 to 1977, and again from 1983 to 1985. Green wrote several books, including ``George Bush: An Intimate Portrait'' published in 1989.
