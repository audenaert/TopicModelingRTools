 A woman is suing the city for allegedly violating the air space above her property by building a five-story-high pedestrian bridge. ``In the olden days, your property ran to the center of the Earth up to the heavens,'' said Michael Martinis, attorney for Ann B. White. ``Now it is interpreted to be the usable air space above your property.'' The lawsuit filed Friday in Marion County Circuit Court demands that the city recognize her right to use and enjoy the space above her land. It seeks no monetary compensation except attorney fees. ``We want a judge to sort out everybody's rights,'' Martinis said. If the defendants recognize White's right, the lawsuit would be dropped, he said. The walkway connects a garage to Capitol Center, an office building owned by Salem Historical Associates, a limited partnership based in California. The bridge passes high above a parking area behind the Tahiti Restaurant and Lounge, which White owns and leases. David DeMartino, deputy city attorney, said he had not seen the complaint and could not comment. He could not recall the city previously being sued for violation of air space.
