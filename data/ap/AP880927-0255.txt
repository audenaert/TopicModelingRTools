 ``Broadcast News'' (CBS-Fox Video; VHS@Beta, $89.98; Rated R) One advantage in seeing ``Broadcast News'' at home is the opportunity to give the film a more satisfying ending than the feeble conclusion reached by director James L. Brooks. Just stop when you've had enough _ at least two good opportunities will arise _ and savor the satisfaction of saving a film in the cutting room. For most of its length, though, ``Broadcast News'' is a witty and often hilarious human comedy set in the high-pressure world of network journalism. This highly praised film inexplicably was snubbed at the Academy Award ceremonies, after winning seven nominations. However, Holly Hunter deservedly won best-actress awards from critics in New York and Los Angeles. Hunter and Albert Brooks play bright, dedicated and tough news professionals who worry about the inroads of fluffy feature stories and blow-dried airheads on the anchor desk. We know they are the very best of journalists because they say so, rather often. Their media Eden is invaded by a blow-dried, airhead snake named Tom Grunick (William Hurt). However, Tom establishes himself as a sympathetic figure. He's the only character who appears to have any humility, admitting that he's no genius and forthrightly asking help from Jane Craig (Hunter). What he knows is how to look good and sound smart, and he generously offers tips on anchoring to Aaron Altman (Brooks) _ perhaps knowing that the neurotic Aaron is no competition. Jane runs at such a high pitch that she often loses perspective. When her boss sarcastically tells her that it must be great to always be the smartest person in the room, she takes him seriously. ``No, it's awful,'' she sobs. Though Brooks and Hurt turn in first-class performances, this is Holly Hunter's movie and it runs on her energy. It's not just the two guys in the film who will fall in love with her. _ By Robert Barr, Associated Press Writer.
