 If you've ever dreamed of making it on to the cover of a Wheaties box, dream no more. General Mills Inc., the maker of the ``Breakfast of Champions,'' is inviting everyone to appear on a Wheaties box. But unlike recent box subjects like Walter Payton and the Minnesota Twins, the public will have to pay. The promotion, beginning next week, offers individualized Wheaties boxes for $18.95 and proof of purchase. Eight weeks after sending in the money and a black-and-white picture, people will receive a single, acrylic-sealed box with their picture on the cover, the company says. ``Customers have been writing letters to us for many, many years wondering how they could get their picture on the Wheaties box,'' General Mills spokeswoman Kathryn Newton said. The boxes also are offered for $13.95 and five proof-of-purchase coupons.
