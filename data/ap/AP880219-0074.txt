 The City Council has determined there may be a free lunch, but it won't be gourmet. The council on Thursday agreed to halt meals provided at its meetings by members of the Dallas Restaurant Association because of a possible conflict of interest if they consider measures affecting restaurateurs. The restaurants had been serving such fare as baby spring chicken and chocolate decadence cake since the council stopped a city food service that had cost $4,600 per year. Mayor Annette Strauss has written C. Gus Katsigris, president of the association, thanking the association for ``gracious and delicious luncheon service.'' But she said the lunches must be discontinued because they ``may be subject to misinterpretation.'' ``I'm disappointed,'' said Katsigris. ``I don't think we can influence anyone with a cup of soup and some salad.'' Although it appears the city will resume food service for the council members, not eveyone favors the idea. Councilman Jerry Bartos said he supports canceling free lunches altogether: ``I'd be just as happy with a sandwich on whole wheat out of my own pocket.''
