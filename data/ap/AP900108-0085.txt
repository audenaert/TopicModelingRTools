 Police said Monday they have arrested a man in Hong Kong in connection with the seizure of 143 pounds of heroin concealed in cans of Chinese fruit imported to Los Angeles. The man was arrested Saturday after U.S. authorities discovered the high-grade heroin hidden in 192 cans of litchis in syrup found in Los Angeles last month, police said. The drugs would have sold for about $64 million in the United States, the statement said. Officers of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and U.S. Customs also arrested two men _ a Chinese and a Vietnamese _ in Alhambra, Calif., on Saturday in connection with the drug bust, the statement said. The man in Hong Kong was arrested after police raided sites in the colony and uncovered a drug packaging center in an industrial building, police said. No names were released and investigations into the case were continuing.
