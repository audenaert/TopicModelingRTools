 At least 40 people suffered broken bones or heat exhaustion after the crowd surged toward the stage at a rock concert, authorities said. The incident occurred at Greenville Memorial Auditorium just before the start of a concert Tuesday night featuring David Lee Roth and Poison. ``They got caught up in the action, scared to death, being pushed up against the stage. They were sort of crushed between the crowd and the stage, and they couldn't breathe real good because of that,'' said Pat Browning, county Emergency Medical Service director. Several spectators suffered broken bones, EMS said. The building is air conditioned, but the crush of people made the temperature soar in front of the stage, said Clifford Gray, executive director of the auditorium. Four ambulances were called to the auditorium and an infirmary was set up, Gray said. Nine people were taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital, a spokeswoman said. ``Those people (the crowd) just don't have any regard for human life,'' said Inez Jones, whose daughter Terry was one of those treated at the hospital.
