 National Semiconductor Corp. has been granted a temporary restraining order against Cypress Semiconductor Corp. and Aspen Semiconductor, a new Cypress subsidiary. The order granted on Thursday bars the companies from using proprietary information of National or Fairchild Semiconductor, which Fairchild bought last year. ``We are not willing to subsidize research and development for our competitors,'' said James Smaha, executive vice president of National's semiconductor group. National filed suit in Santa Clara County Superior Court earlier Thursday against Cypress, charging theft of trade secrets. Narpat Bhandari, a former Fairchild manager, is accused in the suit of taking confidential Fairchild documents to the new subsidiary. The suit involved a major new chipmaking technology developed over five years by Fairchild.
