And the here of his hed of his hors swete.

Watz euesed al vmbetorne abof his elbowes,

Of a kyngez capados that closes his swyre;

On botounz of the bryght grene brayden ful ryche.

To knyghtez he kest his yghe,
And reled hym vp and doun;

As growe grene as the gres and grener hit semed,

Wyth al the wonder of the worlde what he worch schulde.
For fele sellyez had thay sen, bot such neuer are;
Forthi for fantoum and fayryghe the folk there hit demed.

And al stouned at his steuen and stonstil seten
In a swoghe sylence thurgh the sale riche; 
As al were slypped vpon slepe so slaked hor lotez

And rekenly hym reuerenced, for rad was he neuer,
And sayde, 'Wyghe, welcum iwys to this place,

Light luflych adoun and lenge, I the praye,
And quat-so thy wylle is we schal wyt after.'
'Nay, as help me,' quoth the hathel, 'he that on hyghe syttes,
To wone any quyle in this won, hit watz not myn ernde;
Bot for the los of the, lede, is lyft vp so hyghe,
And thy burgh and thy burnes best ar holden,

And here is kydde cortaysye, as I haf herd carp,
And that hatz wayned me hider, iwyis, at this tyme.
Ȝe may be seker bi this braunch that I bere here

For had I founded in fere in feghtyng wyse,

A schelde and a scharp spere, schinande bryght,
Ande other weppenes to welde, I wene wel, als;
Bot for I wolde no were, my wedez ar softer.
Bot if thou be so bold as alle burnez tellen,

Arthour con onsware,
And sayd, 'Sir cortays knyght,
If thou craue batayl bare,
Here faylez thou not to fyght.'
'Nay, frayst I no fyght, in fayth I the telle,
Hit arn aboute on this bench bot berdlez chylder.
If I were hasped in armes on a heghe stede, 
Here is no mon me to mach, for myghtez so wayke.
Forthy I craue in this court a Crystemas gomen,
For hit is Ȝol and Nwe Ȝer, and here ar ghep mony:
If any so hardy in this hous holdez hymseluen,
Be so bolde in his blod, brayn in hys hede,
that dar stifly strike a strok for an other,
I schal gif hym of my gyft thys giserne ryche,

And I schal bide the fyrst bur as bare as I sitte.
If any freke be so felle to fonde that I telle,
Lepe lyghtly me to, and lach this weppen,
I quit-clayme hit for euer, kepe hit as his auen,
And I schal stonde hym a strok, stif on this flet,
Ellez thou wyl dight me the dom to dele hym an other

And ghet gif hym respite,
A twelmonyth and a day;
Now hyghe, and let se tite

If he hem stowned vpon fyrst, stiller were thanne
Alle the heredmen in halle, the hygh and the loghe.

And runischly his rede yghen he reled aboute,
Bende his bresed broghez, blycande grene,
Wayued his berde for to wayte quo-so wolde ryse.
When non wolde kepe hym with carp he coghed ful hyghe,
Ande rimed hym ful richly, and ryght hym to speke:
'What, is this Arthures hous,' quoth the hathel thenne,
'that al the rous rennes of thurgh ryalmes so mony?
Where is now your sourquydrye and your conquestes,
Your gryndellayk and your greme, and your grete wordes?
Now is the reuel and the renoun of the Rounde Table
Ouerwalt wyth a worde of on wyghes speche,
For al dares for drede withoute dynt schewed!'
Wyth this he laghes so loude that the lorde greued;

He wex as wroth as wynde,
So did alle that ther were.
the kyng as kene bi kynde
then stod that stif mon nere,
Ande sayde, 'Hathel, by heuen, thyn askyng is nys,
And as thou foly hatz frayst, fynde the behoues.
I know no gome that is gast of thy grete wordes;
Gif me now thy geserne, vpon Godez halue,
And I schal baythen thy bone that thou boden habbes.' 
Lyghtly lepez he hym to, and laght at his honde.

Now hatz Arthure his axe, and the halme grypez,
And sturnely sturez hit aboute, that stryke wyth hit thoght.

Herre then ani in the hous by the hede and more.
Wyth sturne schere ther he stod he stroked his berde,
And wyth a countenaunce dryghe he drogh doun his cote,
No more mate ne dismayd for hys mayn dintez

Gawan, that sate bi the quene,
To the kyng he can enclyne:
'I beseche now with saghez sene

'Wolde ghe, worthilych lorde,' quoth Gawan to the kyng,
'Bid me boghe fro this benche, and stonde by yow there,

And that my legge lady lyked not ille,

For me think hit not semly, as hit is soth knawen,

Whil mony so bolde yow aboute vpon bench sytten,

Bot for as much as ghe ar myn em I am only to prayse,

And sythen this note is so nys that noght hit yow falles,
And I haue frayned hit at yow fyrst, foldez hit to me;
And if I carp not comlyly, let alle this cort rych

Ryche togeder con roun,
And sythen thay redden alle same
To ryd the kyng wyth croun,
And gif Gawan the game. 
then comaunded the kyng the knyght for to ryse;
And he ful radly vpros, and ruchched hym fayre,
Kneled doun bifore the kyng, and cachez that weppen;
And he luflyly hit hym laft, and lyfte vp his honde,
And gef hym Goddez blessyng, and gladly hym biddes
that his hert and his honde schulde hardi be bothe.
'Kepe the, cosyn,' quoth the kyng, 'that thou on kyrf sette,
And if thou redez hym ryght, redly I trowe

Gawan gotz to the gome with giserne in honde,
And he baldly hym bydez, he bayst neuer the helder.
then carppez to Sir Gawan the knyght in the grene,
'Refourme we oure forwardes, er we fyrre passe.
Fyrst I ethe the, hathel, how that thou hattes

'In god fayth,' quoth the goode knyght, 'Gawan I hatte,

And at this tyme twelmonyth take at the an other
Wyth what weppen so thou wylt, and wyth no wygh ellez

'Sir Gawan, so mot I thryue
As I am ferly fayn

'Bigog,' quoth the grene knyght, 'Sir Gawan, me lykes
that I schal fange at thy fust that I haf frayst here.
And thou hatz redily rehersed, bi resoun ful trwe, 
Clanly al the couenaunt that I the kynge asked,
Saf that thou schal siker me, segge, bi thi trawthe,
that thou schal seche me thiself, where-so thou hopes

As thou deles me to-day bifore this douthe ryche.'
'Where schulde I wale the,' quoth Gauan, 'where is thy place?
I wot neuer where thou wonyes, bi hym that me wroght,

Bot teche me truly therto, and telle me how thou hattes,
And I schal ware alle my wyt to wynne me theder, 
And that I swere the for sothe, and by my seker traweth.'
'that is innogh in Nwe Ȝer, hit nedes no more',
Quoth the gome in the grene to Gawan the hende;
'Ȝif I the telle trwly, quen I the tape haue
And thou me smothely hatz smyten, smartly I the teche
Of my hous and my home and myn owen nome,

And if I spende no speche, thenne spedez thou the better,
For thou may leng in thy londe and layt no fyrre--

And let se how thou cnokez.'
'Gladly, sir, for sothe',
Quoth Gawan; his ax he strokes.

A littel lut with the hede, the lere he discouerez,
His longe louelych lokkez he layd ouer his croun,
Let the naked nec to the note schewe.
Gauan gripped to his ax, and gederes hit on hyght,

Let him doun lyghtly lyght on the naked,

And schrank thurgh the schyire grece, and schade hit in twynne,

the blod brayd fro the body, that blykked on the grene; 
And nawther faltered ne fel the freke neuer the helder,
Bot stythly he start forth vpon styf schonkes,
And runyschly he raght out, there as renkkez stoden,
Laght to his lufly hed, and lyft hit vp sone;
And sythen boghez to his blonk, the brydel he cachchez,
Steppez into stelbawe and strydez alofte,
And his hede by the here in his honde haldez;
And as sadly the segge hym in his sadel sette
As non vnhap had hym ayled, thagh hedlez he were

He brayde his bulk aboute,

Moni on of hym had doute,
Bi that his resounz were redde.
For the hede in his honde he haldez vp euen,
Toward the derrest on the dece he dressez the face,
And hit lyfte vp the yghe-lyddez and loked ful brode,
And meled thus much with his muthe, as ghe may now here:
'Loke, Gawan, thou be graythe to go as thou hettez,
And layte as lelly til thou me, lude, fynde,
As thou hatz hette in this halle, herande thise knyghtes;
To the grene chapel thou chose, I charge the, to fotte
Such a dunt as thou hatz dalt--disserued thou habbez
To be ghederly gholden on Nw Ȝeres morn.

Forthi me for to fynde if thou fraystez, faylez thou neuer.

With a runisch rout the raynez he tornez,
Halled out at the hal dor, his hed in his hande,

To quat kyth he becom knwe non there,

He let no semblaunt be sene, bot sayde ful hyghe
To the comlych quene wyth cortays speche,
'Dere dame, to-day demay yow neuer;
Wel bycommes such craft vpon Cristmasse,
Laykyng of enterludez, to laghe and to syng,
Among thise kynde caroles of knyghtez and ladyez.

For I haf sen a selly, I may not forsake.'
He glent vpon Sir Gawen, and gaynly he sayde,
'Now, sir, heng vp thyn ax, that hatz innogh hewen'; 
And hit watz don abof the dece on doser to henge,

And bi trwe tytel therof to telle the wonder.

Of alle dayntyez double, as derrest myght falle;
Wyth alle maner of mete and mynstralcie bothe,
Wyth wele walt thay that day, til worthed an ende

Now thenk wel, Sir Gawan,
For wothe that thou ne wonde

Passus II
THIS hanselle hatz Arthur of auenturus on fyrst
In ghonge gher, for he gherned ghelpyng to here.
Thagh hym wordez were wane when thay to sete wenten,
Now ar thay stoken of sturne werk, stafful her hond.
Gawan watz glad to begynne those gomnez in halle,
Bot thagh the ende be heuy haf ghe no wonder;
For thagh men ben mery in mynde quen thay han mayn drynk,
A ghere ghernes ful gherne, and gheldez neuer lyke,

Forthi this Ȝol ouerghede, and the ghere after,
And vche sesoun serlepes sued after other: 
After Crystenmasse com the crabbed lentoun,
that fraystez flesch wyth the fysche and fode more symple;
Bot thenne the weder of the worlde wyth wynter hit threpez,
Colde clengez adoun, cloudez vplyften,
Schyre schedez the rayn in schowrez ful warme,
Fallez vpon fayre flat, flowrez there schewen,
Bothe groundez and the greuez grene ar her wedez,
Bryddez busken to bylde, and bremlych syngen
For solace of the softe somer that sues therafter
bi bonk;
And blossumez bolne to blowe
Bi rawez rych and ronk,
then notez noble innoghe

Ar herde in wod so wlonk.
After the sesoun of somer wyth the soft wyndez
Quen Zeferus syflez hymself on sedez and erbez,
Wela wynne is the wort that waxes theroute,
When the donkande dewe dropez of the leuez,
To bide a blysful blusch of the bryght sunne.
Bot then hyghes heruest, and hardenes hym sone,
Warnez hym for the wynter to wax ful rype;
He dryues wyth droght the dust for to ryse,
Fro the face of the folde to flyghe ful hyghe;
Wrothe wynde of the welkyn wrastelez with the sunne,
the leuez lancen fro the lynde and lyghten on the grounde,
And al grayes the gres that grene watz ere;

And thus ghirnez the ghere in ghisterdayez mony,
And wynter wyndez aghayn, as the worlde askez,

Til Meghelmas mone

then thenkkez Gawan ful sone
Of his anious uyage.
Ȝet quyl Al-hal-day with Arther he lenges;
And he made a fare on that fest for the frekez sake,
With much reuel and ryche of the Rounde Table. 
Knyghtez ful cortays and comlych ladies
Al for luf of that lede in longynge thay were,
Bot neuer the lece ne the later thay neuened bot merthe:
Mony ioylez for that ientyle iapez ther maden.
For aftter mete with mournyng he melez to his eme,
And spekez of his passage, and pertly he sayde,
'Now, lege lorde of my lyf, leue I yow ask;
Ȝe knowe the cost of this cace, kepe I no more
To telle yow tenez therof neuer bot trifel;
Bot I am boun to the bur barely to-morne
To sech the gome of the grene, as God wyl me wysse.'

And mony other menskful, with Mador de la Port.
Alle this compayny of court com the kyng nerre
For to counseyl the knyght, with care at her hert.
there watz much derue doel driuen in the sale
that so worthé as Wawan schulde wende on that ernde,
To dryghe a delful dynt, and dele no more

the knyght mad ay god chere,
And sayde, 'Quat schuld I wonde?
Of destinés derf and dere
What may mon do bot fonde?'
He dowellez ther al that day, and dressez on the morn,
Askez erly hys armez, and alle were thay broght.
Fyrst a tulé tapit tyght ouer the flet,
And miche watz the gyld gere that glent theralofte;
the stif mon steppez theron, and the stel hondelez,
Dubbed in a dublet of a dere tars,
And sythen a crafty capados, closed aloft,
that wyth a bryght blaunner was bounden withinne.
thenne set thay the sabatounz vpon the segge fotez,
His legez lapped in stel with luflych greuez,
With polaynez piched therto, policed ful clene,
Aboute his knez knaged wyth knotez of golde;
Queme quyssewes then, that coyntlych closed
His thik thrawen thyghez, with thwonges to tachched;
And sythen the brawden bryné of bryght stel ryngez
Vmbeweued that wygh vpon wlonk stuffe,
And wel bornyst brace vpon his bothe armes,
With gode cowters and gay, and glouez of plate,
And alle the godlych gere that hym gayn schulde

Wyth ryche cote-armure,
His gold sporez spend with pryde,
Gurde wyth a bront ful sure
With silk sayn vmbe his syde.  
When he watz hasped in armes, his harnays watz ryche:
the lest lachet other loupe lemed of golde.
So harnayst as he watz he herknez his masse,
Offred and honoured at the heghe auter.
Sythen he comez to the kyng and to his cort-ferez,
Lachez lufly his leue at lordez and ladyez;
And thay hym kyst and conueyed, bikende hym to Kryst.
Bi that watz Gryngolet grayth, and gurde with a sadel
that glemed ful gayly with mony golde frenges,
Ayquere naylet ful nwe, for that note ryched;
the brydel barred aboute, with bryght golde bounden;

the cropore and the couertor, acorded wyth the arsounez;
And al watz rayled on red ryche golde naylez,
that al glytered and glent as glem of the sunne.
thenne hentes he the helme, and hastily hit kysses,
that watz stapled stifly, and stoffed wythinne.
Hit watz hyghe on his hede, hasped bihynde,
Wyth a lyghtly vrysoun ouer the auentayle,
Enbrawden and bounden wyth the best gemmez
On brode sylkyn borde, and bryddez on semez,
As papiayez paynted peruyng bitwene,
Tortors and trulofez entayled so thyk
As mony burde theraboute had ben seuen wynter

the cercle watz more o prys

Of diamauntez a deuys

THEN thay schewed hym the schelde, that was of schyr goulez
Wyth the pentangel depaynt of pure golde hwez.
He braydez hit by the bauderyk, aboute the hals kestes,
that bisemed the segge semlyly fayre.
And quy the pentangel apendez to that prynce noble
I am in tent yow to telle, thof tary hyt me schulde:
Hit is a syngne that Salamon set sumquyle
In bytoknyng of trawthe, bi tytle that hit habbez, 
For hit is a figure that haldez fyue poyntez,
And vche lyne vmbelappez and loukez in other,
And ayquere hit is endelez; and Englych hit callen
Oueral, as I here, the endeles knot.
Forthy hit acordez to this knyght and to his cler armez,
For ay faythful in fyue and sere fyue sythez
Gawan watz for gode knawen, and as golde pured,
Voyded of vche vylany, wyth vertuez ennourned
in mote;
Forthy the pentangel nwe
He ber in schelde and cote,
As tulk of tale most trwe
And gentylest knyght of lote.
Fyrst he watz funden fautlez in his fyue wyttez,
And efte fayled neuer the freke in his fyue fyngres,
And alle his afyaunce vpon folde watz in the fyue woundez
that Cryst kaght on the croys, as the crede tellez;
And quere-so-euer thys mon in melly watz stad,
His thro thoght watz in that, thurgh alle other thyngez,
that alle his forsnes he feng at the fyue joyez
that the hende heuen-quene had of hir chylde;
At this cause the knyght comlyche hade
In the inore half of his schelde hir ymage depaynted,
that quen he blusched therto his belde neuer payred. 
the fyft fyue that I finde that the frek vsed
Watz fraunchyse and felaghschyp forbe al thyng,
His clannes and his cortaysye croked were neuer,
And pité, that passez alle poyntez, thyse pure fyue
Were harder happed on that hathel then on any other.
Now alle these fyue sythez, for sothe, were fetled on this knyght,
And vchone halched in other, that non ende hade,
And fyched vpon fyue poyntez, that fayld neuer,
Ne samned neuer in no syde, ne sundred nouther,
Withouten ende at any noke I oquere fynde,
Whereeuer the gomen bygan, or glod to an ende.
therfore on his schene schelde schapen watz the knot
Ryally wyth red golde vpon rede gowlez,  
that is the pure pentaungel wyth the peple called
with lore.
Now graythed is Gawan gay,
And laght his launce ryght thore,
And gef hem alle goud day,
He wende for euermore.
He sperred the sted with the spurez and sprong on his way,
So stif that the ston-fyr stroke out therafter.
Al that segh that semly syked in hert,
And sayde sothly al same segges til other,
Carande for that comly: 'Bi Kryst, hit is scathe
that thou, leude, schal be lost, that art of lyf noble!
To fynde hys fere vpon folde, in fayth, is not ethe.
Warloker to haf wroght had more wyt bene,
And haf dyght ghonder dere a duk to haue worthed;
A lowande leder of ledez in londe hym wel semez,
And so had better haf ben then britned to noght,
Hadet wyth an aluisch mon, for angardez pryde.
Who knew euer any kyng such counsel to take
As knyghtez in cauelaciounz on Crystmasse gomnez!'
Wel much watz the warme water that waltered of yghen,
When that semly syre soght fro tho wonez

Bot wyghtly went hys way;
Mony wylsum way he rode,

Now ridez this renk thurgh the ryalme of Logres,

Oft leudlez alone he lengez on nyghtez

Hade he no fere bot his fole bi frythez and dounez,
Ne no gome bot God bi gate wyth to karp,
Til that he neghed ful neghe into the Northe Walez.
Alle the iles of Anglesay on lyft half he haldez,
And farez ouer the fordez by the forlondez,
Ouer at the Holy Hede, til he hade eft bonk
In the wyldrenesse of Wyrale; wonde ther bot lyte 
that auther God other gome wyth goud hert louied.
And ay he frayned, as he ferde, at frekez that he met,
If thay hade herde any karp of a knyght grene,
In any grounde theraboute, of the grene chapel;
And al nykked hym wyth nay, that neuer in her lyue

Mony klyf he ouerclambe in contrayez straunge,
Fer floten fro his frendez fremedly he rydez.
At vche warthe other water ther the wyghe passed
He fonde a foo hym byfore, bot ferly hit were,
And that so foule and so felle that feght hym byhode.
So mony meruayl bi mount ther the mon fyndez,
Hit were to tore for to telle of the tenthe dole.
Sumwhyle wyth wormez he werrez, and with wolues als,
Sumwhyle wyth wodwos, that woned in the knarrez,
Bothe wyth bullez and berez, and borez otherquyle,
And etaynez, that hym anelede of the heghe felle; 
Nade he ben dughty and dryghe, and Dryghtyn had serued,
Douteles he hade ben ded and dreped ful ofte.
For werre wrathed hym not so much that wynter nas wors,
When the colde cler water fro the cloudez schadde,
And fres er hit falle myght to the fale erthe;
Ner slayn wyth the slete he sleped in his yrnes
Mo nyghtez then innoghe in naked rokkez,

And henged heghe ouer his hede in hard iisse-ikkles.

Bi contray cayrez this knyght, tyl Krystmasse euen,

And wysse hym to sum wone.
Bi a mounte on the morne meryly he rydes
Into a forest ful dep, that ferly watz wylde,
Highe hillez on vche a halue, and holtwodez vnder
Of hore okez ful hoge a hundreth togeder;
the hasel and the haghthorne were harled al samen,
With roghe raged mosse rayled aywhere,
With mony bryddez vnblythe vpon bare twyges,
that pitosly ther piped for pyne of the colde.
the gome vpon Gryngolet glydez hem vnder,
thurgh mony misy and myre, mon al hym one,
Carande for his costes, lest he ne keuer schulde
To se the seruyse of that syre, that on that self nyght
Of a burde watz borne oure baret to quelle;
And therfore sykyng he sayde, 'I beseche the, lorde,
And Mary, that is myldest moder so dere,
Of sum herber ther heghly I myght here masse,
Ande thy matynez to-morne, mekely I ask,
And therto prestly I pray my pater and aue

He rode in his prayere,
And cryed for his mysdede, 
He sayned hym in sythes sere,
And sayde 'Cros Kryst me spede!'
NADE he sayned hymself, segge, bot thrye,
Er he watz war in the wod of a won in a mote,
Abof a launde, on a lawe, loken vnder boghez
Of mony borelych bole aboute bi the diches:
A castel the comlokest that euer knyght aghte,

With a pyked palays pyned ful thik,

'Now bone hostel,' cothe the burne, 'I beseche yow ghette!'
thenne gerdez he to Gryngolet with the gilt helez,
And he ful chauncely hatz chosen to the chef gate,

Of the depe double dich that drof to the place;

Ande eft a ful huge heght hit haled vpon lofte
Of harde hewen ston vp to the tablez,
Enbaned vnder the abataylment in the best lawe;
And sythen garytez ful gaye gered bitwene,
Wyth mony luflych loupe that louked ful clene:
A better barbican that burne blusched vpon neuer.
And innermore he behelde that halle ful hyghe,

Fayre fylyolez that fyghed, and ferlyly long, 
With coruon coprounes craftyly sleghe.

So mony pynakle payntet watz poudred ayquere,
Among the castel carnelez clambred so thik,

To herber in that hostel whyl halyday lested,

On the wal his ernd he nome,
And haylsed the knyght erraunt.
'Gode sir,' quoth Gawan, 'woldez thou go myn ernde
To the hegh lorde of this hous, herber to craue?' 
'Ȝe, Peter,' quoth the porter, 'and purely I trowee

then ghede the wyghe gherne and com aghayn swythe,
And folke frely hym wyth, to fonge the knyght.

And kneled doun on her knes vpon the colde erthe
To welcum this ilk wygh as worthy hom thoght;
thay gholden hym the brode ghate, gharked vp wyde,
And he hem raysed rekenly, and rod ouer the brygge.
Sere seggez hym sesed by sadel, quel he lyght,
And sythen stabeled his stede stif men innoghe.

For to bryng this buurne wyth blys into halle;
Quen he hef vp his helme, ther highed innoghe
For to hent hit at his honde, the hende to seruen;
His bronde and his blasoun bothe thay token.
then haylsed he ful hendly tho hathelez vchone,
And mony proud mon ther presed that prynce to honour.
Alle hasped in his hegh wede to halle thay hym wonnen,

thenne the lorde of the lede loutez fro his chambre 
For to mete wyth menske the mon on the flor;
He sayde, 'Ȝe ar welcum to welde as yow lykez

'Graunt mercy,' quoth Gawayn,
'ther Kryst hit yow forghelde.'
As frekez that semed fayn
Ayther other in armez con felde.
Gawayn glyght on the gome that godly hym gret,
And thught hit a bolde burne that the burgh aghte,
A hoge hathel for the nonez, and of hyghe eldee;

Felle face as the fyre, and fre of hys speche;
And wel hym semed, for sothe, as the segge thught,
To lede a lortschyp in lee of leudez ful gode. 
the lorde hym charred to a chambre, and chefly cumaundez
To delyuer hym a leude, hym loghly to serue;
And there were boun at his bode burnez innoghe,

Of cortynes of clene sylk wyth cler golde hemmez,
And couertorez ful curious with comlych panez
Of bryght blaunner aboue, enbrawded bisydez,

And vnder fete, on the flet, of folghande sute.

Ryche robes ful rad renkkez hym broghten,

Of a broun bleeaunt, enbrauded ful ryche
And fayre furred wythinne with fellez of the best,

And achaufed hym chefly, and thenne his cher mended.

Ful hendely, quen alle the hatheles rehayted hym at onez,

For wyn in his hed that wende.

And hit watz Wawen hymself that in that won syttez, 
Comen to that Krystmasse, as case hym then lymped.
When the lorde hade lerned that he the leude hade,
Loude laghed he therat, so lef hit hym thoght,
And alle the men in that mote maden much joye
To apere in his presense prestly that tyme,

Apendes to hys persoun, and praysed is euer;
Byfore alle men vpon molde his mensk is the most.
Vch segge ful softly sayde to his fere:

When burnez blythe of his burthe schal sitte

Bi that the diner watz done and the dere vp

To the hersum euensong of the hyghe tyde.

Into a cumly closet coyntly ho entrez.
Gawan glydez ful gay and gos theder sone;

And couthly hym knowez and callez hym his nome,
And sayde he watz the welcomest wyghe of the worlde;
And he hym thonkked throly, and ayther halched other,
And seten soberly samen the seruise quyle.
thenne lyst the lady to loke on the knyght,

Ho watz the fayrest in felle, of flesche and of lyre,
And of compas and colour and costes, of alle other, 
And wener then Wenore, as the wyghe thoght.
Ho ches thurgh the chaunsel to cheryche that hende.
An other lady hir lad bi the lyft honde,

And heghly honowred with hathelez aboute.
Bot vnlyke on to loke tho ladyes were,
For if the ghonge watz ghep, gholghe watz that other;

Schon schyrer then snawe that schedez on hillez;

When Gawayn glyght on that gay, that graciously loked,
Wyth leue laght of the lorde he lent hem aghaynes;

He kysses hir comlyly, and knyghtly he melez.

To be her seruaunt sothly, if hemself lyked.

And wayned hom to wynne the worchip therof,

For to glade Sir Gawayn with gomnez in halle

And sythen thurgh al the sale as hem best semed.
Bi vche grome at his degré graythely watz serued

Much dut watz ther dryuen that day and that other,
And the thryd as thro thronge in therafter;

And watz the last of the layk, leudez ther thoghten.

At the last, when hit watz late, thay lachen her leue,

Gawan gef hym god day, the godmon hym lachchez,
Ledes hym to his awen chambre, the chymné bysyde,
And there he draghez hym on dryghe, and derely hym thonkkez
Of the wynne worschip that he hym wayued hade,
As to honour his hous on that hyghe tyde,
And enbelyse his burgh with his bele chere:
'Iwysse sir, quyl I leue, me worthez the better

'Grant merci, sir,' quoth Gawayn, 'in god fayth hit is yowrez,
Al the honour is your awen--the heghe kyng yow ghelde!
And I am wyghe at your wylle to worch youre hest,
As I am halden therto, in hyghe and in loghe,

the lorde fast can hym payne
To holde lenger the knyght;
To hym answarez Gawayn

Then frayned the freke ful fayre at himseluen
Quat derue dede had hym dryuen at that dere tyme
So kenly fro the kyngez kourt to kayre al his one,
Er the halidayez holly were halet out of toun.
'For sothe, sir,' quoth the segge, 'ghe sayn bot the trawthe,
A heghe ernde and a hasty me hade fro tho wonez,
For I am sumned myselfe to sech to a place,

With bugle to bent-felde he buskez bylyue.

Vnder couertour ful clere, cortyned aboute;
And as in slomeryng he slode, sleghly he herde
A littel dyn at his dor, and dernly vpon;
And he heuez vp his hed out of the clothes,

And boghed towarde the bed; and the burne schamed,
And layde hym doun lystyly, and let as he slepte;
And ho stepped stilly and stel to his bedde,

And set hir ful softly on the bed-syde,
And lenged there selly longe to loke quen he wakened.

And vnlouked his yghe-lyddez, and let as hym wondered,
And sayned hym, as bi his saghe the sauer to worthe,

'God moroun, Sir Gawayn,' sayde that gay lady,
'Ȝe ar a sleper vnslyghe, that mon may slyde hider;

Al laghande the lady lanced tho bourdez.

'Me schal worthe at your wille, and that me wel lykez,
For I ghelde me ghederly, and gheghe after grace,
And that is the best, be my dome, for me byhouez nede':
And thus he bourded aghayn with mony a blythe laghter.
'Bot wolde ghe, lady louely, then leue me grante,
And deprece your prysoun, and pray hym to ryse,

'Nay for sothe, beau sir,' sayd that swete,
'Ȝe schal not rise of your bedde, I rych yow better,

'In god fayth,' quoth Gawayn, 'gayn hit me thynkkez,

Of a rasse bi a rokk ther rennez the boerne.

Whettez his whyte tuschez; with hym then irked
Alle the burnez so bolde that hym by stoden

Til the knyght com hymself, kachande his blonk,
Sygh hym byde at the bay, his burnez bysyde;

In the wyghtest of the water; the worre hade that other,
For the mon merkkez hym wel, as thay mette fyrst,
Set sadly the scharp in the slot euen,
Hit hym vp to the hult, that the hert schyndered,
And he gharrande hym ghelde, and ghedoun the water

A hundreth houndez hym hent,

Burnez him broght to bent,
And doggez to dethe endite.
There watz blawyng of prys in mony breme horne,

Of that chargeaunt chace that were chef huntes.

And sythen rendez him al roghe bi the rygge after,
Braydez out the boweles, brennez hom on glede,
With bred blent therwith his braches rewardez.
Sythen he britnez out the brawen in bryght brode cheldez,
And hatz out the hastlettez, as hightly bisemez;
And ghet hem halchez al hole the haluez togeder,
And sythen on a stif stange stoutly hem henges.
Now with this ilk swyn thay swengen to home;

When he seghe Sir Gawayn, with solace he spekez;

He schewez hem the scheldez, and schapes hem the tale
Of the largesse and the lenthe, the lithernez alse
Of the were of the wylde swyn in wod ther he fled.
that other knyght ful comly comended his dedez,
And praysed hit as gret prys that he proued hade,
For suche a brawne of a best, the bolde burne sayde,
Ne such sydes of a swyn segh he neuer are.
thenne hondeled thay the hoge hed, the hende mon hit praysed, 
And let lodly therat the lorde for to here.
'Now, Gawayn,' quoth the godmon, 'this gomen is your awen
Bi fyn forwarde and faste, faythely ghe knowe.'
'Hit is sothe,' quoth the segge, 'and as siker trwe
Alle my get I schal yow gif agayn, bi my trawthe.'
He hent the hathel aboute the halse, and hendely hym kysses,
And eftersones of the same he serued hym there.
'Now ar we euen,' quoth the hathel, 'in this euentide
Of alle the couenauntes that we knyt, sythen I com hider,

the lorde sayde, 'Bi saynt Gile,
Ȝe ar the best that I knowe! 
Ȝe ben ryche in a whyle,
Such chaffer and ghe drowe.'
thenne thay teldet tablez trestes alofte,
Kesten clothen vpon; clere lyght thenne
Wakned bi woghez, waxen torches;
Seggez sette and serued in sale al aboute;
Much glam and gle glent vp therinne
Aboute the fyre vpon flet, and on fele wyse
At the soper and after, mony athel songez,
As coundutes of Krystmasse and carolez newe
With al the manerly merthe that mon may of telle,
And euer oure luflych knyght the lady bisyde.
Such semblaunt to that segge semly ho made
Wyth stille stollen countenaunce, that stalworth to plese,

Bot he nolde not for his nurture nurne hir aghaynez,
Bot dalt with hir al in daynté, how-se-euer the dede turned

Quen thay hade played in halle
As longe as hor wylle hom last,
To chambre he con hym calle,
And to the chemné thay past.
Ande ther thay dronken, and dalten, and demed eft nwe
To norne on the same note on Nwe Ȝerez euen;
Bot the knyght craued leue to kayre on the morn,
For hit watz negh at the terme that he to schulde. 
the lorde hym letted of that, to lenge hym resteyed,
And sayde, 'As I am trwe segge, I siker my trawthe

Leude, on Nw Ȝerez lyght, longe bifore pryme.
Forthy thow lye in thy loft and lach thyn ese,
And I schal hunt in this holt, and halde the towchez,
Chaunge wyth the cheuisaunce, bi that I charre hider;
For I haf fraysted the twys, and faythful I fynde the.
Now "thrid tyme throwe best" thenk on the morne,
Make we mery quyl we may and mynne vpon joye,
For the lur may mon lach when-so mon lykez.'
this watz graythely graunted, and Gawayn is lenged, 
Blithe broght watz hym drynk, and thay to bedde gheden

Sir Gawayn lis and slepes
Ful stille and softe al night;

Ful erly he watz dight.
After messe a morsel he and his men token;
Miry watz the mornyng, his mounture he askes.
Alle the hatheles that on horse schulde helden hym after
Were boun busked on hor blonkkez bifore the halle ghatez.
Ferly fayre watz the folde, for the forst clenged;
In rede rudede vpon rak rises the sunne,
And ful clere costez the clowdes of the welkyn.
Hunteres vnhardeled bi a holt syde,
Rocheres roungen bi rys for rurde of her hornes;
Summe fel in the fute ther the fox bade,
Traylez ofte a traueres bi traunt of her wyles;
A kenet kyres therof, the hunt on hym calles;
His felaghes fallen hym to, that fnasted ful thike,
Runnen forth in a rabel in his ryght fare,
And he fyskez hem byfore; thay founden hym sone,
And quen thay seghe hym with syght thay sued hym fast,
Wreghande hym ful weterly with a wroth noyse;
And he trantes and tornayeez thurgh mony tene greue,
Hauilounez, and herkenez bi heggez ful ofte. 
At the last bi a littel dich he lepez ouer a spenne,
Stelez out ful stilly bi a strothe rande,
Went haf wylt of the wode with wylez fro the houndes;
thenne watz he went, er he wyst, to a wale tryster,
ther thre thro at a thrich thrat hym at ones,

He blenched aghayn bilyue
And stifly start on-stray,
With alle the wo on lyue
To the wod he went away. 
Thenne watz hit list vpon lif to lythen the houndez,
When alle the mute hade hym met, menged togeder:
Suche a sorghe at that syght thay sette on his hede
As alle the clamberande clyffes hade clatered on hepes;
Here he watz halawed, when hathelez hym metten,
Loude he watz ghayned with gharande speche;
ther he watz threted and ofte thef called,
And ay the titleres at his tayl, that tary he ne myght;
Ofte he watz runnen at, when he out rayked,
And ofte reled in aghayn, so Reniarde watz wylé.
And ghe he lad hem bi lagmon, the lorde and his meyny,
On this maner bi the mountes quyle myd-ouer-vnder,
Whyle the hende knyght at home holsumly slepes
Withinne the comly cortynes, on the colde morne.
Bot the lady for luf let not to slepe,
Ne the purpose to payre that pyght in hir hert,
Bot ros hir vp radly, rayked hir theder
In a mery mantyle, mete to the erthe,
that watz furred ful fyne with fellez wel pured,
No hwef goud on hir hede bot the hagher stones
Trased aboute hir tressour be twenty in clusteres;
Hir thryuen face and hir throte throwen al naked,
Hir brest bare bifore, and bihinde eke.
Ho comez withinne the chambre dore, and closes hit hir after,
Wayuez vp a wyndow, and on the wyghe callez,
And radly thus rehayted hym with hir riche wordes,
with chere:
'A! mon, how may thou slepe, 
this morning is so clere?'
He watz in drowping depe,
Bot thenne he con hir here.
In dregh droupyng of dreme draueled that noble,
As mon that watz in mornyng of mony thro thoghtes,
How that destiné schulde that day dele hym his wyrde
At the grene chapel, when he the gome metes,
And bihoues his buffet abide withoute debate more;
Bot quen that comly com he keuered his wyttes, 
Swenges out of the sweuenes, and swarez with hast.
the lady luflych com laghande swete,
Felle ouer his fayre face, and fetly hym kyssed;
He welcumez hir worthily with a wale chere.
He segh hir so glorious and gayly atyred,
So fautles of hir fetures and of so fyne hewes,
Wight wallande joye warmed his hert.
With smothe smylyng and smolt thay smeten into merthe,
that al watz blis and bonchef that breke hem bitwene,

Much wele then watz therinne;
Gret perile bitwene hem stod,
Nif Maré of hir knyght mynne.
For that prynces of pris depresed hym so thikke,
Nurned hym so neghe the thred, that nede hym bihoued
Other lach ther hir luf, other lodly refuse.
He cared for his cortaysye, lest crathayn he were,
And more for his meschef ghif he schulde make synne,
And be traytor to that tolke that that telde aght.
'God schylde,' quoth the schalk, 'that schal not befalle!'
With luf-laghyng a lyt he layd hym bysyde
Alle the spechez of specialté that sprange of her mouthe.
Quoth that burde to the burne, 'Blame ghe disserue,
Ȝif ghe luf not that lyf that ghe lye nexte,
Bifore alle the wyghez in the worlde wounded in hert,
Bot if ghe haf a lemman, a leuer, that yow lykez better,
And folden fayth to that fre, festned so harde 
that yow lausen ne lyst--and that I leue nouthe;
And that ghe telle me that now trwly I pray yow,
For alle the lufez vpon lyue layne not the sothe

the knyght sayde, 'Be sayn Jon,'
And smethely con he smyle,
'In fayth I welde right non,
Ne non wil welde the quile.'
'that is a worde,' quoth that wyght, 'that worst is of alle, 
Bot I am swared for sothe, that sore me thinkkez.
Kysse me now comly, and I schal cach hethen,
I may bot mourne vpon molde, as may that much louyes.'
Sykande ho sweghe doun and semly hym kyssed,
And sithen ho seueres hym fro, and says as ho stondes,
'Now, dere, at this departyng do me this ese,
Gif me sumquat of thy gifte, thi gloue if hit were,
that I may mynne on the, mon, my mournyng to lassen.'
'Now iwysse,' quoth that wyghe, 'I wolde I hade here
the leuest thing for thy luf that I in londe welde,
For ghe haf deserued, for sothe, sellyly ofte
More rewarde bi resoun then I reche myght;
Bot to dele yow for drurye that dawed bot neked,
Hit is not your honour to haf at this tyme
A gloue for a garysoun of Gawaynez giftez,
And I am here an erande in erdez vncouthe,
And haue no men wyth no malez with menskful thingez;
that mislykez me, ladé, for luf at this tyme,
Iche tolke mon do as he is tan, tas to non ille

'Nay, hende of hyghe honours,'
Quoth that lufsum vnder lyne,
'thagh I hade noght of yourez,
Ȝet schulde ghe haue of myne.'
Ho raght hym a riche rynk of red golde werkez,
Wyth a starande ston stondande alofte
that bere blusschande bemez as the bryght sunne;
Wyt ghe wel, hit watz worth wele ful hoge.
Bot the renk hit renayed, and redyly he sayde, 
'I wil no giftez, for Gode, my gay, at this tyme;
I haf none yow to norne, ne noght wyl I take.'
Ho bede hit hym ful bysily, and he hir bode wernes,
And swere swyfte by his sothe that he hit sese nolde,
And ho soré that he forsoke, and sayde therafter,
'If ghe renay my rynk, to ryche for hit semez,
Ȝe wolde not so hyghly halden be to me,
I schal gif yow my girdel, that gaynes yow lasse.' 
Ho laght a lace lyghtly that leke vmbe hir sydez,
Knit vpon hir kyrtel vnder the clere mantyle,
Gered hit watz with grene sylke and with golde schaped,
Noght bot arounde brayden, beten with fyngrez;
And that ho bede to the burne, and blythely bisoght,
thagh hit vnworthi were, that he hit take wolde.
And he nay that he nolde neghe in no wyse
Nauther golde ne garysoun, er God hym grace sende
To acheue to the chaunce that he hade chosen there.
'And therfore, I pray yow, displese yow noght,
And lettez be your bisinesse, for I baythe hit yow neuer
to graunte;
I am derely to yow biholde
Bicause of your sembelaunt,
And euer in hot and colde
To be your trwe seruaunt.'
'Now forsake ghe this silke,' sayde the burde thenne,
'For hit is symple in hitself? And so hit wel semez.
Lo! so hit is littel, and lasse hit is worthy;
Bot who-so knew the costes that knit ar therinne,
He wolde hit prayse at more prys, parauenture;
For quat gome so is gorde with this grene lace,
While he hit hade hemely halched aboute,
ther is no hathel vnder heuen tohewe hym that myght,
For he myght not be slayn for slyght vpon erthe.'
then kest the knyght, and hit come to his hert
Hit were a juel for the jopardé that hym iugged were:
When he acheued to the chapel his chek for to fech,
Myght he haf slypped to be vnslayn, the sleght were noble. 
thenne he thulged with hir threpe and tholed hir to speke,
And ho bere on hym the belt and bede hit hym swythe--
And he granted and hym gafe with a goud wylle--
And bisoght hym, for hir sake, disceuer hit neuer,
Bot to lelly layne fro hir lorde; the leude hym acordez
that neuer wyghe schulde hit wyt, iwysse, bot thay twayne
for noghte;
He thonkked hir oft ful swythe,
Ful thro with hert and thoght. 
Bi that on thrynne sythe
Ho hatz kyst the knyght so toght.
Thenne lachchez ho hir leue, and leuez hym there,
For more myrthe of that mon moght ho not gete.
When ho watz gon, Sir Gawayn gerez hym sone,
Rises and riches hym in araye noble,
Lays vp the luf-lace the lady hym raght,
Hid hit ful holdely, ther he hit eft fonde.
Sythen cheuely to the chapel choses he the waye,
Preuély aproched to a prest, and prayed hym there
that he wolde lyste his lyf and lern hym better
How his sawle schulde be saued when he schuld seye hethen.
there he schrof hym schyrly and schewed his mysdedez,
Of the more and the mynne, and merci besechez,
And of absolucioun he on the segge calles;
And he asoyled hym surely and sette hym so clene
As domezday schulde haf ben dight on the morn.
And sythen he mace hym as mery among the fre ladyes,
With comlych caroles and alle kynnes ioye,
As neuer he did bot that daye, to the derk nyght,
with blys.
Vche mon hade daynté thare
Of hym, and sayde, 'Iwysse,

Syn he com hider, er this.'
Now hym lenge in that lee, ther luf hym bityde!
Ȝet is the lorde on the launde ledande his gomnes.
He hatz forfaren this fox that he folghed longe;
As he sprent ouer a spenne to spye the schrewe, 
ther as he herd the howndes that hasted hym swythe,
Renaud com richchande thurgh a roghe greue,
And alle the rabel in a res ryght at his helez.
the wyghe watz war of the wylde, and warly abides,
And braydez out the bryght bronde, and at the best castez.
And he schunt for the scharp, and schulde haf arered;
A rach rapes hym to, ryght er he myght,
And ryght bifore the hors fete thay fel on hym alle, 
And woried me this wyly wyth a wroth noyse.
the lorde lyghtez bilyue, and lachez hym sone,
Rased hym ful radly out of the rach mouthes,
Haldez heghe ouer his hede, halowez faste,
And ther bayen hym mony brath houndez.
Huntes hyghed hem theder with hornez ful mony,
Ay rechatande aryght til thay the renk seghen.
Bi that watz comen his compeyny noble,
Alle that euer ber bugle blowed at ones,
And alle thise other halowed that hade no hornes;
Hit watz the myriest mute that euer men herde,

Hor houndez thay ther rewarde,
Her hedez thay fawne and frote,
And sythen thay tan Reynarde,
And tyruen of his cote.
And thenne thay helden to home, for hit watz niegh nyght,
Strakande ful stoutly in hor store hornez.
the lorde is lyght at the laste at hys lef home,
Fyndez fire vpon flet, the freke ther-byside,
Sir Gawayn the gode, that glad watz withalle,
Among the ladies for luf he ladde much ioye;
He were a bleaunt of blwe that bradde to the erthe,
His surkot semed hym wel that softe watz forred,
And his hode of that ilke henged on his schulder,
Blande al of blaunner were bothe al aboute.
He metez me this godmon inmyddez the flore,
And al with gomen he hym gret, and goudly he sayde,
'I schal fylle vpon fyrst oure forwardez nouthe, 
that we spedly han spoken, ther spared watz no drynk.'
then acoles he the knyght and kysses hym thryes,
As sauerly and sadly as he hem sette couthe.
'Bi Kryst,' quoth that other knyght, 'Ȝe cach much sele
In cheuisaunce of this chaffer, ghif ghe hade goud chepez.'
'Ȝe, of the chepe no charg,' quoth chefly that other,
'As is pertly payed the chepez that I aghte.' 
'Mary,' quoth that other mon, 'myn is bihynde,
For I haf hunted al this day, and noght haf I geten
Bot this foule fox felle--the fende haf the godez!--
And that is ful pore for to pay for suche prys thinges
As ghe haf thryght me here thro, suche thre cosses

'Inogh,' quoth Sir Gawayn,
'I thonk yow, bi the rode',
And how the fox watz slayn
He tolde hym as thay stode.
With merthe and mynstralsye, with metez at hor wylle,
thay maden as mery as any men moghten--
With laghyng of ladies, with lotez of bordes
Gawayn and the godemon so glad were thay bothe--
Bot if the douthe had doted, other dronken ben other.
Bothe the mon and the meyny maden mony iapez,
Til the sesoun watz seghen that thay seuer moste;
Burnez to hor bedde behoued at the laste.
thenne loghly his leue at the lorde fyrst
Fochchez this fre mon, and fayre he hym thonkkez:
'Of such a selly soiorne as I haf hade here,
Your honour at this hyghe fest, the hyghe kyng yow ghelde!
I ghef yow me for on of yourez, if yowreself lykez,
For I mot nedes, as ghe wot, meue to-morne,
And ghe me take sum tolke to teche, as ghe hyght,

To dele on Nw Ȝerez day the dome of my wyrdes.'
'In god faythe,' quoth the godmon, 'wyth a goud wylle
Al that euer I yow hyght halde schal I redé.'
ther asyngnes he a seruaunt to sett hym in the waye, 
And coundue hym by the downez, that he no drechch had,
For to ferk thurgh the fryth and fare at the gaynest
bi greue.
the lorde Gawayn con thonk,
Such worchip he wolde hym weue.
then at tho ladyez wlonk
the knyght hatz tan his leue. 
With care and wyth kyssyng he carppez hem tille,
And fele thryuande thonkkez he thrat hom to haue,
And thay ghelden hym aghayn gheply that ilk;
thay bikende hym to Kryst with ful colde sykyngez.
Sythen fro the meyny he menskly departes;
Vche mon that he mette, he made hem a thonke
For his seruyse and his solace and his sere pyne,
that thay wyth busynes had ben aboute hym to serue;
And vche segge as soré to seuer with hym there
As thay hade wonde worthyly with that wlonk euer.
then with ledes and lyght he watz ladde to his chambre
And blythely broght to his bedde to be at his rest.
Ȝif he ne slepe soundyly say ne dar I,
For he hade muche on the morn to mynne, ghif he wolde,
in thoght.
Let hym lyghe there stille,
He hatz nere that he soght;
And ghe wyl a whyle be stylle
I schal telle yow how thay wroght.
Passus IV
NOW neghez the Nw Ȝere, and the nyght passez,
the day dryuez to the derk, as Dryghtyn biddez;
Bot wylde wederez of the worlde wakned theroute,
Clowdes kesten kenly the colde to the erthe,
Wyth nyghe innoghe of the northe, the naked to tene;
the snawe snitered ful snart, that snayped the wylde;
the werbelande wynde wapped fro the hyghe,
And drof vche dale ful of dryftes ful grete.
the leude lystened ful wel that legh in his bedde,
thagh he lowkez his liddez, ful lyttel he slepes;
Bi vch kok that crue he knwe wel the steuen. 
Deliuerly he dressed vp, er the day sprenged,
For there watz lyght of a laumpe that lemed in his chambre;
He called to his chamberlayn, that cofly hym swared,
And bede hym bryng hym his bruny and his blonk sadel; 
that other ferkez hym vp and fechez hym his wedez,
And graythez me Sir Gawayn vpon a grett wyse.
Fyrst he clad hym in his clothez the colde for to were,
And sythen his other harnays, that holdely watz keped,
Bothe his paunce and his platez, piked ful clene,
the ryngez rokked of the roust of his riche bruny;
And al watz fresch as vpon fyrst, and he watz fayn thenne

He hade vpon vche pece,
Wypped ful wel and wlonk;
the gayest into Grece,
the burne bede bryng his blonk.
Whyle the wlonkest wedes he warp on hymseluen--
His cote wyth the conysaunce of the clere werkez
Ennurned vpon veluet, vertuus stonez
Aboute beten and bounden, enbrauded semez,
And fayre furred withinne wyth fayre pelures--
Ȝet laft he not the lace, the ladiez gifte,
that forgat not Gawayn for gode of hymseluen.
Bi he hade belted the bronde vpon his balghe haunchez,
thenn dressed he his drurye double hym aboute,
Swythe swethled vmbe his swange swetely that knyght
the gordel of the grene silke, that gay wel bisemed,
Vpon that ryol red clothe that ryche watz to schewe.
Bot wered not this ilk wyghe for wele this gordel,
For pryde of the pendauntez, thagh polyst thay were,
And thagh the glyterande golde glent vpon endez,
Bot for to sauen hymself, when suffer hym byhoued,
To byde bale withoute dabate of bronde hym to were

Bi that the bolde mon boun
Wynnez theroute bilyue,
Alle the meyny of renoun
He thonkkez ofte ful ryue. 
Thenne watz Gryngolet graythe, that gret watz and huge,
And hade ben soiourned sauerly and in a siker wyse,
Hym lyst prik for poynt, that proude hors thenne. 
the wyghe wynnez hym to and wytez on his lyre,
And sayde soberly hymself and by his soth swerez:
'Here is a meyny in this mote that on menske thenkkez,
the mon hem maynteines, ioy mot thay haue;
the leue lady on lyue luf hir bityde;
Ȝif thay for charyté cherysen a gest,
And halden honour in her honde, the hathel hem ghelde
that haldez the heuen vpon hyghe, and also yow alle!
And ghif I myght lyf vpon londe lede any quyle,
I schuld rech yow sum rewarde redyly, if I myght.'
thenn steppez he into stirop and strydez alofte;
His schalk schewed hym his schelde, on schulder he hit laght,
Gordez to Gryngolet with his gilt helez,
And he startez on the ston, stod he no lenger
to praunce.
His hathel on hors watz thenne,
that bere his spere and launce.
'this kastel to Kryst I kenne':
He gef hit ay god chaunce.
The brygge watz brayde doun, and the brode ghatez
Vnbarred and born open vpon bothe halue.
the burne blessed hym bilyue, and the bredez passed--
Prayses the porter bifore the prynce kneled,
Gef hym God and goud day, that Gawayn he saue--
And went on his way with his wyghe one,
that schulde teche hym to tourne to that tene place
ther the ruful race he schulde resayue.
thay boghen bi bonkkez ther boghez ar bare,

the heuen watz vphalt, bot vgly ther-vnder;
Mist muged on the mor, malt on the mountez,
Vch hille hade a hatte, a myst-hakel huge.

Wela wylle watz the way ther thay bi wod schulden,
Til hit watz sone sesoun that the sunne ryses

the burne that rod hym by
Bede his mayster abide.
'For I haf wonnen yow hider, wyghe, at this tyme,
And now nar ghe not fer fro that note place
that ghe han spied and spuryed so specially after;
Bot I schal say yow for sothe, sythen I yow knowe,
And ghe ar a lede vpon lyue that I wel louy,
Wolde ghe worch bi my wytte, ghe worthed the better.
the place that ghe prece to ful perelous is halden;
ther wonez a wyghe in that waste, the worst vpon erthe,
For he is stiffe and sturne, and to strike louies,
And more he is then any mon vpon myddelerde,
And his body bigger then the best fowre
that ar in Arthurez hous, Hestor, other other.
He cheuez that chaunce at the chapel grene,
ther passes non bi that place so proude in his armes
that he ne dyngez hym to dethe with dynt of his honde;
For he is a mon methles, and mercy non vses,
For be hit chorle other chaplayn that bi the chapel rydes,
Monk other masseprest, other any mon elles,
Hym thynk as queme hym to quelle as quyk go hymseluen.
Forthy I say the, as sothe as ghe in sadel sitte,
Com ghe there, ghe be kylled, may the knyght rede,
Trawe ghe me that trwely, thagh ghe had twenty lyues

He hatz wonyd here ful ghore,
On bent much baret bende,
Aghayn his dyntez sore
Ȝe may not yow defende.
'Forthy, goude Sir Gawayn, let the gome one,
And gotz away sum other gate, vpon Goddez halue!
Cayrez bi sum other kyth, ther Kryst mot yow spede,
And I schal hygh me hom aghayn, and hete yow fyrre 
that I schal swere bi God and alle his gode halghez,
As help me God and the halydam, and othez innoghe,
that I schal lelly yow layne, and lance neuer tale

'Grant merci', quoth Gawayn, and gruchyng he sayde:
'Wel worth the, wyghe, that woldez my gode,
And that lelly me layne I leue wel thou woldez.
Bot helde thou hit neuer so holde, and I here passed,
Founded for ferde for to fle, in fourme that thou tellez,
I were a knyght kowarde, I myght not be excused.
Bot I wyl to the chapel, for chaunce that may falle,
And talk wyth that ilk tulk the tale that me lyste,
Worthe hit wele other wo, as the wyrde lykez

thaghe he be a sturn knape
To stightel, and stad with staue,
Ful wel con Dryghtyn schape

'Mary!' quoth that other mon, 'now thou so much spellez,
that thou wylt thyn awen nye nyme to thyseluen,
And the lyst lese thy lyf, the lette I ne kepe.
Haf here thi helme on thy hede, thi spere in thi honde,
And ryde me doun this ilk rake bi ghon rokke syde,
Til thou be broght to the bothem of the brem valay;
thenne loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde,
And thou schal se in that slade the self chapel,
And the borelych burne on bent that hit kepez.
Now farez wel, on Godez half, Gawayn the noble!
For alle the golde vpon grounde I nolde go wyth the,
Ne bere the felaghschip thurgh this fryth on fote fyrre.'
Bi that the wyghe in the wod wendez his brydel,
Hit the hors with the helez as harde as he myght,
Lepez hym ouer the launde, and leuez the knyght there
al one.
'Bi Goddez self,' quoth Gawayn,
'I wyl nauther grete ne grone;
To Goddez wylle I am ful bayn,
And to hym I haf me tone.' 
Thenne gyrdez he to Gryngolet, and gederez the rake,
Schowuez in bi a schore at a schaghe syde,
Ridez thurgh the roghe bonk ryght to the dale; 
And thenne he wayted hym aboute, and wylde hit hym thoght,
And seghe no syngne of resette bisydez nowhere,
Bot hyghe bonkkez and brent vpon bothe halue,
And rughe knokled knarrez with knorned stonez;
the skwez of the scowtes skayned hym thoght.
thenne he houed, and wythhylde his hors at that tyde,
And ofte chaunged his cher the chapel to seche:
He segh non suche in no syde, and selly hym thoght,
Saue, a lyttel on a launde, a lawe as hit were;
A balgh bergh bi a bonke the brymme bysyde,
Bi a forgh of a flode that ferked thare;
the borne blubred therinne as hit boyled hade.
the knyght kachez his caple, and com to the lawe,
Lightez doun luflyly, and at a lynde tachez
the rayne and his riche with a roghe braunche.
thenne he boghez to the berghe, aboute hit he walkez,
Debatande with hymself quat hit be myght.
Hit hade a hole on the ende and on ayther syde,
And ouergrowen with gresse in glodes aywhere,
And al watz holgh inwith, nobot an olde caue,
Or a creuisse of an olde cragge, he couthe hit noght deme
with spelle.
'We! Lorde,' quoth the gentyle knyght,
'Whether this be the grene chapelle?
Here myght aboute mydnyght
the dele his matynnes telle!
'Now iwysse,' quoth Wowayn, 'wysty is here;
this oritore is vgly, with erbez ouergrowen;
Wel bisemez the wyghe wruxled in grene
Dele here his deuocioun on the deuelez wyse.
Now I fele hit is the fende, in my fyue wyttez,
that hatz stoken me this steuen to strye me here.
this is a chapel of meschaunce, that chekke hit bytyde!
Hit is the corsedest kyrk that euer I com inne!' 
With heghe helme on his hede, his launce in his honde,
He romez vp to the roffe of the rogh wonez. 
thene herde he of that hyghe hil, in a harde roche
Bighonde the broke, in a bonk, a wonder breme noyse,
Quat! hit clatered in the clyff, as hit cleue schulde,
As one vpon a gryndelston hade grounden a sythe.
What! hit wharred and whette, as water at a mulne;
What! hit rusched and ronge, rawthe to here.
thenne 'Bi Godde,' quoth Gawayn, 'that gere, as I trowe,
Is ryched at the reuerence me, renk, to mete
bi rote.
Let God worche! "We loo"--
Hit helppez me not a mote.
My lif thagh I forgoo,
Drede dotz me no lote.'
Thenne the knyght con calle ful hyghe:
'Who stightlez in this sted me steuen to holde?
For now is gode Gawayn goande ryght here.
If any wyghe oght wyl, wynne hider fast,
Other now other neuer, his nedez to spede.'
'Abyde', quoth on on the bonke abouen ouer his hede,
'And thou schal haf al in hast that I the hyght ones.'
Ȝet he rusched on that rurde rapely a throwe.
And wyth quettyng awharf, er he wolde lyght;
And sythen he keuerez bi a cragge, and comez of a hole,
Whyrlande out of a wro wyth a felle weppen,
A denez ax nwe dyght, the dynt with to ghelde,
With a borelych bytte bende by the halme,
Fyled in a fylor, fowre fote large--
Hit watz no lasse bi that lace that lemed ful bryght--
And the gome in the grene gered as fyrst,
Bothe the lyre and the leggez, lokkez and berde,
Saue that fayre on his fote he foundez on the erthe,
Sette the stele to the stone, and stalked bysyde.
When he wan to the watter, ther he wade nolde,
He hypped ouer on hys ax, and orpedly strydez,
Bremly brothe on a bent that brode watz aboute,
on snawe. 
Sir Gawayn the knyght con mete,
He ne lutte hym nothyng lowe; 
that other sayde, 'Now, sir swete,
Of steuen mon may the trowe.'
'Gawayn,' quoth that grene gome, 'God the mot loke!
Iwysse thou art welcom, wyghe, to my place,
And thou hatz tymed thi trauayl as truee mon schulde,
And thou knowez the couenauntez kest vus bytwene:
At this tyme twelmonyth thou toke that the falled,
And I schulde at this Nwe Ȝere gheply the quyte.
And we ar in this valay verayly oure one;
Here ar no renkes vs to rydde, rele as vus likez.
Haf thy helme of thy hede, and haf here thy pay.
Busk no more debate then I the bede thenne
When thou wypped of my hede at a wap one.'
'Nay, bi God,' quoth Gawayn, 'that me gost lante,
I schal gruch the no grwe for grem that fallez.
Bot styghtel the vpon on strok, and I schal stonde stylle
And warp the no wernyng to worch as the lykez,
nowhare.'
He lened with the nek, and lutte,
And schewed that schyre al bare,
And lette as he noght dutte;
For drede he wolde not dare.
THEN the gome in the grene graythed hym swythe,
Gederez vp hys grymme tole Gawayn to smyte;
With alle the bur in his body he ber hit on lofte,
Munt as maghtyly as marre hym he wolde;
Hade hit dryuen adoun as dregh as he atled,
ther hade ben ded of his dynt that doghty watz euer.
Bot Gawayn on that giserne glyfte hym bysyde,
As hit com glydande adoun on glode hym to schende,
And schranke a lytel with the schulderes for the scharp yrne.
that other schalk wyth a schunt the schene wythhaldez,
And thenne repreued he the prynce with mony prowde wordez:
'thou art not Gawayn,' quoth the gome, 'that is so goud halden,
that neuer arghed for no here by hylle ne be vale, 
And now thou fles for ferde er thou fele harmez!
Such cowardise of that knyght cowthe I neuer here. 
Nawther fyked I ne flaghe, freke, quen thou myntest,
Ne kest no kauelacion in kyngez hous Arthor.
My hede flagh to my fote, and ghet flagh I neuer;
And thou, er any harme hent, arghez in hert;
Wherfore the better burne me burde be called
therfore.'
Quoth Gawayn, 'I schunt onez,
And so wyl I no more;
Bot thagh my hede falle on the stonez,
I con not hit restore.
'Bot busk, burne, bi thi fayth, and bryng me to the poynt.
Dele to me my destiné, and do hit out of honde,
For I schal stonde the a strok, and start no more
Til thyn ax haue me hitte: haf here my trawthe.'
'Haf at the thenne!' quoth that other, and heuez hit alofte,
And waytez as wrothely as he wode were.
He myntez at hym maghtyly, bot not the mon rynez,
Withhelde heterly his honde, er hit hurt myght.
Gawayn graythely hit bydez, and glent with no membre,
Bot stode stylle as the ston, other a stubbe auther
that ratheled is in roché grounde with rotez a hundreth.
then muryly efte con he mele, the mon in the grene:
'So, now thou hatz thi hert holle, hitte me bihous.
Halde the now the hyghe hode that Arthur the raght,
And kepe thy kanel at this kest, ghif hit keuer may.'
Gawayn ful gryndelly with greme thenne sayde:
'Wy! thresch on, thou thro mon, thou thretez to longe;
I hope that thi hert arghe wyth thyn awen seluen.'
'For sothe,' quoth that other freke, 'so felly thou spekez,
I wyl no lenger on lyte lette thin ernde
right nowe.'
thenne tas he hym strythe to stryke,
And frounsez bothe lyppe and browe;
No meruayle thagh hym myslyke
that hoped of no rescowe.
He lyftes lyghtly his lome, and let hit doun fayre 
With the barbe of the bitte bi the bare nek; 
thagh he homered heterly, hurt hym no more
Bot snyrt hym on that on syde, that seuered the hyde.
the scharp schrank to the flesche thurgh the schyre grece,
that the schene blod ouer his schulderes schot to the erthe;
And quen the burne segh the blode blenk on the snawe,
He sprit forth spenne-fote more then a spere lenthe,
Hent heterly his helme, and on his hed cast,
Schot with his schulderez his fayre schelde vnder,
Braydez out a bryght sworde, and bremely he spekez--
Neuer syn that he watz burne borne of his moder
Watz he neuer in this worlde wyghe half so blythe--
'Blynne, burne, of thy bur, bede me no mo!
I haf a stroke in this sted withoute stryf hent,
And if thow rechez me any mo, I redyly schal quyte,
And ghelde ghederly aghayn--and therto ghe tryst--
and foo.
Bot on stroke here me fallez--
the couenaunt schop ryght so,
Fermed in Arthurez hallez--
And therfore, hende, now hoo!'
The hathel heldet hym fro, and on his ax rested,
Sette the schaft vpon schore, and to the scharp lened,
And loked to the leude that on the launde ghede,
How that doghty, dredles, deruely ther stondez
Armed, ful aghlez: in hert hit hym lykez.
thenn he melez muryly wyth a much steuen,
And wyth a rynkande rurde he to the renk sayde:
'Bolde burne, on this bent be not so gryndel.
No mon here vnmanerly the mysboden habbez,
Ne kyd bot as couenaunde at kyngez kort schaped.
I hyght the a strok and thou hit hatz, halde the wel payed;
I relece the of the remnaunt of ryghtes alle other.
Iif I deliuer had bene, a boffet paraunter
I couthe wrotheloker haf waret, to the haf wroght anger.
Fyrst I mansed the muryly with a mynt one,
And roue the wyth no rof-sore, with ryght I the profered 
For the forwarde that we fest in the fyrst nyght,
And thou trystyly the trawthe and trwly me haldez,
Al the gayne thow me gef, as god mon schulde.

For bothe two here I the bede bot two bare myntes

At the thrid thou fayled thore,
And therfor that tappe ta the.
'For hit is my wede that thou werez, that ilke wouen girdel,

Now know I wel thy cosses, and thy costes als,
And the wowyng of my wyf: I wroght hit myseluen.
I sende hir to asay the, and sothly me thynkkez
On the fautlest freke that euer on fote ghede;
As perle bi the quite pese is of prys more,
So is Gawayn, in god fayth, bi other gay knyghtez.
Bot here yow lakked a lyttel, sir, and lewté yow wonted;
Bot that watz for no wylyde werke, ne wowyng nauther,
Bot for ghe lufed your lyf; the lasse I yow blame.'
that other stif mon in study stod a gret whyle,
So agreued for greme he gryed withinne;
Alle the blode of his brest blende in his face,
that al he schrank for schome that the schalk talked.
the forme worde vpon folde that the freke meled:
'Corsed worth cowarddyse and couetyse bothe!
In yow is vylany and vyse that vertue disstryez.'
thenne he kaght to the knot, and the kest lawsez,
Brayde brothely the belt to the burne seluen:
'Lo! ther the falssyng, foule mot hit falle!
For care of thy knokke cowardyse me taght
To acorde me with couetyse, my kynde to forsake,
that is larges and lewté that longez to knyghtez.
Now am I fawty and falce, and ferde haf ben euer
Of trecherye and vntrawthe: bothe bityde sorghe
and care! 
I biknowe yow, knyght, here stylle,
Al fawty is my fare;
Letez me ouertake your wylle
And efte I schal be ware.'
Thenn loghe that other leude and luflyly sayde:
'I halde hit hardily hole, the harme that I hade.
thou art confessed so clene, beknowen of thy mysses,
And hatz the penaunce apert of the poynt of myn egge,
I halde the polysed of that plyght, and pured as clene
As thou hadez neuer forfeted sythen thou watz fyrst borne;
And I gif the, sir, the gurdel that is golde-hemmed,
For hit is grene as my goune. Sir Gawayn, ghe maye
thenk vpon this ilke threpe, ther thou forth thryngez
Among prynces of prys, and this a pure token
Of the chaunce of the grene chapel at cheualrous knyghtez.
And ghe schal in this Nwe Ȝer aghayn to my wonez,
And we schyn reuel the remnaunt of this ryche fest
ful bene.'
ther lathed hym fast the lorde
And sayde: 'With my wyf, I wene,
We schal yow wel acorde,
that watz your enmy kene.'
'Nay, for sothe,' quoth the segge, and sesed hys helme,
And hatz hit of hendely, and the hathel thonkkez,
'I haf soiorned sadly; sele yow bytyde,
And he ghelde hit yow ghare that gharkkez al menskes!
And comaundez me to that cortays, your comlych fere,
Bothe that on and that other, myn honoured ladyez,

Bot hit is no ferly thagh a fole madde,
And thurgh wyles of wymmen be wonen to sorghe,
For so watz Adam in erde with one bygyled,
And Salamon with fele sere, and Samson eftsonez--
Dalyda dalt hym hys wyrde--and Dauyth therafter
Watz blended with Barsabe, that much bale tholed.
Now these were wrathed wyth her wyles, hit were a wynne huge
To luf hom wel, and leue hem not, a leude that couthe. 
For thes wer forne the freest, that folghed alle the sele
Exellently of alle thyse other, vnder heuenryche

And alle thay were biwyled
With wymmen that thay vsed.
thagh I be now bigyled,
Me think me burde be excused.
'Bot your gordel', quoth Gawayn, 'God yow forghelde!
that wyl I welde wyth guod wylle, not for the wynne golde,
Ne the saynt, ne the sylk, ne the syde pendaundes,
For wele ne for worchyp, ne for the wlonk werkkez,

When I ride in renoun, remorde to myseluen

How tender hit is to entyse teches of fylthe;
And thus, quen pryde schal me pryk for prowes of armes,

Wyth yow wyth worschyp--the wyghe hit yow ghelde

'that schal I telle the trwly,' quoth that other thenne,
