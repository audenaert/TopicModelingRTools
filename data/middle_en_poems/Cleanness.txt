Clannesse who so kyndly cowthe comende
& rekken vp alle the resounz that ho by right askez,
Fayre formez myght he fynde in for[th]ering his speche
& in the contrare kark & combraunce huge.
For wonder wroth is the Wyghthat wroght alle thinges
Wyth the freke that in fylthe folghes Hym after,
As renkez of relygioun that reden & syngen
& aprochen to hys presens & prestez arn called;
Thay teen vnto his temmple & temen to hym seluen,
Reken with reuerence thay rychen His auter;
thay hondel ther his aune body & vsen hit bothe.
If thay in clannes be clos thay cleche gret mede;
Bot if thay conterfete crafte & cortaysye wont,
As be honest vtwyth & inwith alle fylthez,
then ar thay synful hemself & sulped altogeder
Bothe God & His gere, & hym to greme cachen.
He is so clene in His courte, the Kyng that al weldez,
& honeste in His housholde & hagherlych serued
With angelez enourled in alle that is clene,
Both withine & withouten in wedez ful bryght;
Nif he nere scoymus & skyg & non scathe louied,
Hit were a meruayl to much, hit moght not falle.
Kryst kydde hit Hymself in a carp onez,
theras He heuened aght happez & hyght hem her medez.
Me mynez on one amonge other, as Mathew recordez,
that thus clanness vnclosez a ful cler speche:
the hathel clene of his hert hapenez ful fayre,
For he schal loke on oure Lorde with a bone chere';
As so saytz, to that syght seche schal he neuer
that any vnclannesse hatz on, auwhere abowte;
For He that flemus vch fylthe fer fro His hert
May not byde that burre that hit His body neghen.
Forthy hyghnot to heuen in haterez totorne,
Ne in the harlatez hod, & handez vnwaschen.
For what vrthly hathel that hyghhonour haldez
Wolde lyke if a ladde com lytherly attyred,
When he were sette solempnely in a sete ryche,
Abof dukez on dece, with dayntys serued?
then the harlot with haste helded to the table,
With rent cokrez at the kne & his clutte traschez,
& his tabarde totorne, & his totez oute,
Other ani on of alle thyse, he schulde be halden vtter,
With mony blame ful bygge, a boffet peraunter,
Hurled to the halle dore & harde theroute schowued,
& be forboden that borghe to bowe thider neuer,
On payne of enprysonment & puttyng in stokkez;
& thus schal he be schent for his schrowde feble,
thaghneuer in talle ne in tuch he trespas more.
& if vnwelcum he were to a worthlych prynce,
ghet hym is the hyghe Kyng harder in her euen;
As Mathew melez in his masse of that man ryche,
that made the mukel mangerye to marie his here dere,
& sende his sonde then to say that thay samne schulde,
& in comly quoyntis to com to his feste:
'For my boles & my borez arn bayted & slayne,
& my fedde foulez fatted with sclaght,
My polyle that is penne-fed & partrykez bothe,
Wyth scheldez of wylde swyn, swanez & cronez,
Al is rotheled & rosted ryght to the sete;
Comez cof to my corte, er hit colde worthe.'
When thay knewen his cal that thider com schulde,
Alle excused hem by the skyly he scape by moght.
On hade boght hym a borgh, he sayde, by hys trawthe:
'Now turne I theder als tyd the toun to byholde.'
Another nayed also & nurned this cawse:
'I haf gherned & ghat ghokkez of oxen,
& for my hyghez hem boght; to bowe haf I mester,
To see hem pulle in the plow aproche me byhouez.'
'& I haf wedded a wyf,' so wer hym the thryd;
'Excuse me at the court, I may not com there.'
thus thay droghhem adreghwith daunger vchone,
that non passed to the plate thaghhe prayed were.
Thenne the ludych lorde lyked ful ille,
& hade dedayn of that dede; ful dryghly he carpez.
He saytz: 'Now for her owne sorghe thay forsaken habbez;
More to wyte is her wrange then any wylle gentyl.
thenne gotz forth, my gomez, the grete streetez,
& forsettz on vche a syde the cete aboute;
the wayferande frekez, on fote & on hors,
Bothe burnez & burdez, the better & the wers,
Lathez hem alle luflyly to lenge at my fest,
& bryngez hem blythly to borghe as barounez thay were,
So that my palays plat ful be pyght al aboute;
thise other wrechez iwysse worthy noght wern.'
then thay cayred & com that the cost waked,
Broghten bachlerez hem wyth that thay by bonkez metten,
Swyerez that swyftly swyed on blonkez,
& als fele vpon fote, of fre & of bonde.
When thay com to the courte keppte weren thay fayre,
Styghtled with the stewarde, stad in the halle,
Ful manerly with marchal mad for to sitte,
As he watz dere of degre dressed his seete.
thenne seggez to the souerayn sayden therafter:
'Lo! Lorde, with your leue, at your lege heste
& at thi banne we haf broght, as thou beden habbez,
Mony renischsche renkez, & ghet is roum more.'
Sayde the lorde to tho ledez, 'Laytez ghet ferre,
Ferre out in the felde, & fechez mo gestez;
Waytez gorstez & greuez, if ani gomez lyggez;
Whatkyn folk so ther fare, fechez hem hider;
Be thay fers, be thay feble, forlotez none,
Be thay hol, be thay halt, be thay onyghed,
& thaghthay ben bothe blynde & balterande cruppelez,
that my hous may holly by halkez by fylled.
For, certez, thyse ilk renkez that me renayed habbe,
& denounced me noght now at this tyme,
Schul neuer sitte in my sale my soper to fele,
Ne suppe on sope of my seve, thaghthaghthay swelt schulde.'
Thenne the sergauntez, at that sawe, swengen theroute,
& diden the dede that [watz] demed, as he deuised hade,
& with peple of alle plytez the palays thay fyllen;
Hit weren not alle on wyuez sunez, wonen with on fader.
Whether thay wern worthy other wers, wel wern thay stowed,
Ay the best byfore & bryghtest atyred,
the derrest at the hyghe dese, that dubbed wer fayrest,
& sythen on lenthe bilooghe ledez inogh.
& ay a[s] segge[s] [serly] semed by her wedez,
So with marschal at her mete mensked thay were.
Clene men in compaynye forknowen wern lyte,
& ghet the symplest in that sale watz serued to the fulle,
Bothe with menske & with mete & mynstrasy noble,
& alle the laykez that a lorde aght in londe schewe.
& thay bigonne to be glad that god drink haden.
& vch mon with his mach made hym at ese.
Now inmyddez the mete the mayster hym bithoght
that he wolde se the semble that samned was there,
& rehayte rekenly the riche & the pou[eren],
& cherisch hem alle with his cher, & chaufen her joye.
then he bowez fro his bour into the brode halle
& to the best on the bench, & bede hym be myry,
Solased hem with semblaunt & syled fyrre,
Tron fro table to table & talkede ay myrthe.
Bot as he ferked ouer the flor, he fande with his yghe,
Hit watz not for a halyday honestly arayed,
A thral thryght in the throng vnthryuandely clothed,
Ne no festiual frok, bot fyled with werkkez;
the gome watz vngarnyst with god men to dele.
& gremed therwith the grete lorde, & greue hym he thoght.
'Say me, frende,' quoth the freke with a felle chere,
'Hov wan thou into this won in wedez so fowle?
the abyt that thou hatz vpon, no halyday hit menskez;
thou, burne, for no brydale art busked in wedez.
How watz thou hardy this hous for thyn vnhap [to] neghe
In on so ratted a robe & rent at the sydez?
thow art a gome vngoderly in that goun febele;
thou praysed me & my place ful pouer & ful [g]nede,
that watz so prest to aproche my presens hereinne.
Hopez thou I be a harlot thi erigaut to prayse?'
that oper burne watz abayst of his brothe wordez,
& hurkelez doun with his hede, the vrthe he biholdez;
He watz so scoumfit of his scylle, lest he skathe hent,
that he ne wyst on worde what he warp schulde.
then the lorde wonder loude laled & cryed,
& talkez to his tormenttourez: 'Takez hym,' he biddez,
'Byndez byhynde, at his bak, bothe two his handez,
& felle fetterez to his fete festenez bylyue;
Stik hym stifly in stokez, & stekez hym therafter
Depe in my doungoun ther doel euer dwellez,
Greuing & gretyng & gryspyng harde
Of tethe tenfully togeder, to teche hym be quoynt.'
Thus comparisunez Kryst the kyndom of heuen
To this frelych feste that fele arn to called;
For alle arn lathed luflyly, the luther & the better,
that euer wern fulghed in font, that fest to haue.
Bot war the wel, if thou wylt, thy wedez ben clene
& honest for the halyday, lest thou harme lache,
For aproch thou to that Prynce of parage noble,
He hates helle no more then hem that ar sowle.
Wich arn thenne thy wedez thou wrappez the inne,
that schal schewe hem so schene schrowde of the best?
Hit arn thy werkez, wyterly, that thou wroght hauez,
& lyued with the lykyng that lyghe in thyn hert;
that tho be frely & fresch fonde in thy lyue,
& fetyse of a fayr forme to fote & to honde,
& sythen alle thyn other lymez lapped ful clene;
thenne may thou se thy Sauior & His sete ryche.
For fele[r] fautez may a freke forfete his blysse,
that he the Souerayn ne se, then for slauthe one;
As for bobaunce & bost & bolnande priyde
throly into the deuelez throte man thryngez bylyue.
For couetyse & colwarde & croked dedez,
For monsworne & mensclaght & to much drynk,
For thefte & for threpyng, vnthonk may mon haue;
For roborrye & riboudrye & resounez vntrwe,
& dsyheriete & depryue dowrie of wydoez,
For marryng of maryagez & mayntnaunce of schrewez,
For traysoun & trichcherye & tyrauntyre bothe,
& for fals famacions & fayned lawez;
Man may mysse the myrthe that much is to prayse
For such vnthewez as thise, & thole much payne,
& in the Creatores cort com neuermore,
Ne neuer see Hym with syght for such sour tournez.
Bot I haue herkned & herde of mony hyghe clerkez,
& als in resounez of ryght red hit myseluen,
that that ilk proper Prynce that paradys weldez
Is displesed at vch a poynt that plyes to scathe;
Bot neuer ghet in no boke breued I herde
that euer He wrek so wytherly on werk that He made,
Ne venged for no vilte of vice ne synne,
Ne so hastyfly watz hot for hatel of His wylle,
Ne neuer so sodenly soght vnsoundely to weng,
As for fylthe of the flesch that foles han vsed;
For, as I fynde, ther He forghet alle His fre thewez,
& wex wod to the wrache for wrath at His hert.
For the fyrste felonye the falce fende wroght
Whyl he watz hyghe in the heuen houen vpon lofte,
Of alle thyse athel aungelez attled the fayrest:
& he vnkyndely, as a karle, kydde a reward.
He seghnoght bot hymself how semly he were,
Bot his Souerayn he forsoke & sade thyse wordez:
`I schal telde vp my trone in the tramountayne,
& by lyke to that Lorde that the lyft made.'
With this worde that he warp, the wrake on hym lyght:
Dryghtyn with His dere dom hym drof to the abyme,
In the mesure of His mode, His metz neuer the lasse.
Bot ther He tynt the tythe dool of His tour ryche:
thaghthe feloun were so fers for his fayre wedez
& his glorious glem that glent so bryght,
As sone as Dryghtynez dome drof to hymseluen,
thikke thowsandez thro thrwen theroute,
Fellen fro the frymament fendez ful blake,
Sweued at the fryst swap as the snaw thikke,
Hurled into helle-hole as the hyue swarmez.
Fylter fenden folk forty dayez lencthe,
Er that styngande storme stynt ne myght;
Bot as smylt mele vnder smal siue smokez forthikke.
So fro heuen to helle that hatel schor laste,
On vche syde of the worlde aywhere ilyche.
ghis, hit watz a brem brest & a byge wrache,
& ghet wrathed not the Wygh; ne the wrech saghtled,
Ne neuer wolde, for wyl[fulnes], his worthy God knawe,
Ne pray Hym for no pite, so proud watz his wylle.
Forthy thaghthe rape were rank, the rawthe watz lytt[el];
thaghhe be kest into kare, he kepes no better.
Bot that oper wrake that wex, on wyghez hit lyght
thurghthe faut of a freke that fayled in trawthe,
Adam inobedyent, ordaynt to blysse.
ther pryuely in paradys his place watz devised,
To lyue ther in lykyng the lenthe of a terme,
& thenne enherite that home that aungelez forgart;
Bot thurghthe eggyng of Eue he ete of an apple
that enpoysened alle peplez that parted fro hem bothe,
For a defence that watz dyght of Dryghtyn Seluen,
& a payne theron put & pertly halden.
the defence watz the fryt that the freke towched,
& the dom is the dethe that drepez vus alle;
Al in mesure & methe watz mad the vengiaunce,
& efte amended with a mayden that make had neuer.
Bot in the thryd watz forthrast al that thryue schuld:
ther watz malys mercyles & mawgre much scheued,
that watz for fylthe vpon folde that the folk vsed,
that then wonyed in the worlde withouten any maysterz.
Hit wern the fayrest of forme & of face als,
the most & the myriest that maked wern euer,
the styfest, the stalworthest that stod euer on fete,
& lengest lyf in hem lent of ledez alle other.
For hit was the forme foster that the folde bred,
the athel aunceterez sunez pat Adam watz called,
To wham God hade geuen alle that gayn were,
Alle the blysse boute blame that bodi myght haue;
& those lykkest to the lede, that lyued next after;
Forthy so semly to see sythen wern none.
ther watz no law to hem layd bot loke to kynde,
& kepe to hit, & alle hit cors clanly fulfylle.
& thenne founden thay fylthe in fleschlych dedez,
& controeued agayn kynde contrare werkez,
& vsed hem vnthryftyly vchon on other,
& als with other, wylsfully, upon a wrange wyse:
So ferly fowled her flesch that the fende loked
How the deghter of the douthe wern derelych fayre,
& fallen in felaghschyp with hem on folken wyse,
& engendered on hem jeauntez with her japez ille.
those wern men methelez & maghty on vrthe,
that for her lodlych laykez alosed thay were;
He watz famed for fre that feght loued best,
& ay the bigest in bale the best watz halden.
& thenne euelez on erthe ernestly grewen
& multyplyed monyfolde inmongez mankynde,
For that the maghty on molde so marre thise other
that the Wyghe that al wroght ful wrothly bygynnez.
When He knew vche contre coruppte in hitseluen,
& vch freke forloyned fro the ryght wayez,
Felle temptande tene towched His hert.
As wyghe wo hym withinne, werp to Hymseluen:
'Me forthynkez ful much that euer I mon made,
Bot I schal delyuer & do away that doten on this molde,
& fleme out of the folde al that flesch werez,
Fro the burne to the best, fro bryddez to fyschez;
Al schal doun & be ded & dryuen out of erthe
that euer I sette saule inne; & sore hit Me rwez
that euer I made hem Myself; bot if I may herafter,
I schal wayte to be war her wrenchez to kepe.'
thenne in worlde watz a wyghe wonyande on lyue,
Ful redy & ful ryghtwys, & rewled hym fayre,
In the drede of Dryghtyn his dayez he vsez,
& ay glydande wyth his God, his grace watz the more.
Hym watz the nome Noe, as is innoghe knawen.
He had thre thryuen sunez, & thay thre wyuez:
Sem sothly that on, that other hyght Cam,
& the jolef Japheth watz gendered the thryd.
Now God in nwy to Noe con speke
Wylde wrakful wordez, in His wylle greued:
'the ende of alle kynez flesch that on vrthe meuez
Is fallen forthwyth My face, & forther hit I thenk.
With her vnworthelych werk Me wlatez withinne;
the gore therof Me hatz greued & the glette nwyed.
I schal strenkle My distresse, & strye al togeder,
Bothe ledez & londe & alle that lyf habbez.
Bot make to the a mancioun, & that is My wylle,
A cofer closed of tres, clanlych planed.
Wyrk wonez therinne for wylde & for tame,
& thenne cleme hit with clay comly within[n]e,
& alle the endentur dryuen daube withouten.
& thus of lenthe & of large that lome thou make:
thre hundred of cupydez thou holde to the lenthe,
Of fyfty fayre ouerthwert forme the brede;
& loke euen that thyn ark haue of heghthe thrette,
& a wyndow wyd vpon[ande] wroght vpon lo[f]te,
In the compas of a cubit kyndely sware;
A wel dutande dor, don on the syde;
Haf hallez therinne & halkez ful mony,
Bothe boske[n]z & bourez & wel bounden penez.
For I schal waken vp a water to wasch alle the worlde,
& quelle alle that is quik with quauende flodez,
Alle that glydez & gotz & gost of lyf habbez;
I schal wast with My wrath that wons vpon vrthe.
Bot My forwarde with the I festen on this wyse,
For thou in reysoun hatz rengned & ryghtwys ben euer:
thou schal enter this ark with thyn athel barnez

Of vche best that berez lyf busk the a cupple,
Of vche clene comly kynde enclose seuen makez,
Of vche horwed in ark halde bot a payre,
For to saue Me the sede of alle ser kyndez.
& ay thou meng with the malez the mete ho-bestez,
Vche payre by payre to plese ayther other;
With alle the fode that may be founde frette thy cofer,
For sustnaunce to yowself & also those other.'
Ful graythely gotz this god man & dos Godez hestes,
In dryghdred & daunger that durst do non other.
Wen hit watz fettled & forged & to the fulle graythed,
thenn con Dryghttyn hym dele dryghly thyse wordez.
'Now Noe,' quoth oure Lorde, 'art thou al redy?
Hatz thou closed thy kyst with clay alle aboute?'
'ghe, Lorde, with thy leue,' sayde the lede thenne,
Al is wroght at thi worde, as thou me wyt lantez.'
'Enter in, thenn,' quoth He, & haf thi wyf with the,
thy thre sunez, withouten threp, & her thre wyuez;
Bestez, as I bedene haue, bosk therinne als,
& when ghe arn staued, styfly stekez yow therinne.
Fro seuen dayez ben seyed I sende out bylyue
Such a rowtande ryge that rayne schal swythe

Schal no flesch vpon folde by fonden onlyue,

& sed that I wyl saue of thyse ser bestez.'
Now Noe neuer sty[n]tez, that niygh[t] he bygynnez,
Er al wer stawed & stoken as the steuen wolde.
Thenne sone com the seuenthe day, when samned wern alle,
& alle woned in the whichche, the wylde & the tame.
then bolned the abyme, & bonkez con ryse,
Waltes out vch walle-heued in ful wode stremez;
Watz no brymme that abod vnbrosten bylyue;

Mony clustered clowde clef alle in clowtez;
Torent vch a rayn-ryfte & rusched to the vrthe,
Fon neuer in forty dayez. & then the flod ryses,
Ouerwaltez vche a wod & the wyde feldez.
For when the water of the welkyn with the worlde mette,
Alle that deth moght dryghe drowned therinne.
ther watz moon for to make when meschef was cnowen,
that noght dowed bot the deth in the depe stremez;
Water wylger ay wax, wonez that stryede,
Hurled into vch hous, hent that ther dowelled.
Fryst feng to the flyght alle that fle myght;
Vuche burde with her barne the byggyng thay leuez
& bowed to the hyghbonk ther brentest hit wern,
& heterly to the hyghe hyllez thay [h]aled on faste.
Bot al watz nedlez her note, for neuer cowthe stynt

Er vch bothom watz brurdful to the bonkez eggez,
& vche a dale so depe that demmed at the brynkez.
the moste mountaynez on mor thenne watz no more dryghe,
& theron flokked the folke, for ferde of the wrake.
Sythen the wylde of the wode on the water flette;
Summe swymmed theron that saue hemself trawed,
Summe styghe to a stud & stared to the heuen,
Rwly wyth a loud rurd rored for drede.
Harez, herttez also, to the hyghe runnen;
Bukkez, bausenez, & bulez to the bonkkez hyghed;
& alle cryed for care to the Kyng of heuen,
Recouerer of the Creator thay cryed vchone,
that amounted the masse, the mase His mercy watz passed,
& alle His pyte departed fro peple that He hated.
Bi that the flod to her fete floghed & waxed,

For hit clam vche a clyffe, cubites fyftene

Hit waltered on the wylde flod, went as hit lyste,
Drof vpon the depe dam, in daunger hit semed,
Withouten mast, other myke, other myry bawelyne,

Other any sweande sayl to seche after hauen,
Bot flote forthe with the flyt of the felle wyndez.
Whederwarde so the water wafte, hit rebounde;
Ofte hit roled on rounde & rered on ende;
Nyf oure Lorde hade ben her lodezmon hem had lumpen harde.
Of the lenthe of Noe lyf to lay a lel date,

Of secounde monyth the seuen[ten]the day ryghtez,
Towalten alle thyse welle-hedez & the water flowed;

Vche hille watz ther hidde with y[th]ez ful graye.
Al watz wasted that ther wonyed the worlde withinne,

That roghly watz the remnaunt that the rac dryuez

Bot quen the Lorde of the lyfte lyked Hymseluen
For to mynne on His mon His meth that abydez,

thenne lasned the llak that large watz are.
then He stac vp the stangez, stoped the wellez,
Bed blynne of the rayn: hit batede as faste;
thenne lasned the loghlowkande togeder.
After harde dayez wern out an hundreth & fyfte,
As that lyftande lome luged aboute.
Where the wynde & the weder warpen hit wolde,
Hit saghtled on a softe day, synkande to grounde;
On a rasse of a rok hit rest at the laste,
On the mounte of Mararach of Armene hilles.

Bot thaghthe kyste in the cragez wern closed to byde,

Bot the hyghest of the eggez vnhuled weren a lyttel,

thenne wafte he vpon his wyndowe, & wysed theroute
A message fro that meyny hem moldez to seche:
that watz the rauen so ronk, that rebel watz euer;
He watz colored as the cole, corbyal vntrwe.
& he fongez to the flyght & fannez on the wyndez,
Halez hyghe vpon hyght to herken tythyngez.
He croukez for comfort when carayne he fyndez
Kast vp on a clyffe ther costese lay drye;
He hade the smelle of the smach & smoltes theder sone,
Fallez on the foule flesch & fyllez his wombe,

How the cheuetayn hym charged that the kyst ghemed.

How alle fodez ther fare, ellez he fynde mete;
Bot the burne bynne borde that bod to hys come
Banned hym ful bytterly with bestes alle samen.
He sechez another sondezmon, & settez on the dou[u]e,
Bryngez that bryght vpon borde, blessed, & sayde:
'Wende, worthelych wyght, vus wonez to seche;
Dryf ouer this dymme water; if thou druye fyndez
Bryng bodworde to bot blysse to vus alle.
thaghthat fowle be false, fre be thou euer.'
Ho wyrle out on the weder on wyngez ful scharpe,

On ark on an euentyde houez the dowue;
On stamyn ho stod & stylle hym abydez.
What! ho broght in hir beke a bronch of olyue,
Gracyously vmbegrouen al with grene leuez;

& the saghtlyng of Hymself with tho sely bestez.
then watz ther joy on that gyn where jumpred er dryghed,
& much comfort in that cofer that watz clay-daubed.
Myryly on a fayr morn, monyth the fyrst,

Ledez loghen in that lome & loked theroute,
How that watterez wern woned & the worlde dryed.
Vchon loued oure Lorde, bot lenged ay stylle
Tyl thay had tythyng fro the Tolke that tyned hem therinne.
then Godez glam to hem glod that gladed hem alle,
Bede hem drawe to the dor: delyuer hem He wolde.
then went thay to the wykket, hit walt vpon sone;
Bothe the burne & his barnez bowed theroute,
Her wyuez walkez hem wyth & the wylde after,
throly thrublande in thronge, throwen ful thykke.
Bot Noe of vche honest kynde nem out an odde,
& heuened vp an auter & halghed hit fayre,
& sette a sakerfyse theron of vch a ser kynde
that watz comly & clene: God kepez non other.
When bremly brened those bestez, & the brethe rysed,
the sauour of his sacrafyse soght to Hym euen
that al spedez & spyllez; He spekes with that ilke
In comly comfort ful clos & cortays wordez:
'Now, Noe, no more nel I neuer wary
Alle the mukel mayny [on] molde for no mannez synnez,
For I se wel that hit is sothe that alle mannez wyttez
To vnthryfte arn alle thrawen with thoght of her herttez,
& ay hatz ben, & wyl be ghet; fro her barnage
Al is the mynde of the man to malyce enclyned.
Forthy schal I neuer schende so schortly at ones
As dysstrye al for manez synne, dayez of this erthe.
Bot waxez now & wendez forth & worthez to monye,
Multyplyez on this molde, & menske yow bytyde.
Sesounez schal yow neuer sese of sede ne of heruest,
Ne hete, ne no harde forst, vmbre ne droghthe,
Ne the swetnesse of somer, ne the sadde wynter,
Ne the nyght, ne the day, ne the newe gherez,
Bot euer renne restlez: rengnez ghe therinne.'
therwyth He blessez vch a best, & bytaght hem this erthe.
then watz a skylly skyualde, quen scaped alle the wylde,
Vche fowle to the flyght that fytherez myght serue,
Vche fysch to the flod that fynne couthe nayte.
Vche beste to the bent that that bytes on erbez;
Wylde wormez to her won wrythez in the erthe,

Herttes to hyghe hethe, harez to gorstez,
& lyounez & lebardez to the lake-ryftes:
Hernez & hauekez to the hyghe rochez,

& vche best at a brayde ther hym best lykez;
the fowre frekez of the folde fongez the empyre.
Lo! suche a wrakful wo for wlatsum dedez
Parformed the hyghe Fader on folke that He made;
that He chysly hade cherisched He chastysed ful hardee,
In devoydynge the vylanye that venkquyst His thewez.
Forthy war the now, wyghe that worschyp desyres
In His comlych courte that Kyng is of blysse,
In the fylthe of the flesch that thou be founden neuer,
Tyl any water in the worlde to wasche the fayly.
For is no segge vnder sunne so seme of his craftez,
If he be sulped in synne, that syttez vnclene;
On spec of spote may spede to mysse
Of the syghte of the Souerayn that syttez so hyghe;
For that schewe me schale in tho schyre howsez,
As the beryl bornyst byhouez be clene.
that is sounde on vche a syde & no sem habes,
Withouten maskle other mote, as margerye-perle.
Sythen the Souerayn in sete so sore forthoght
that euer He man vpon molde merked to lyuy,
For he in fylthe watz fallen, felly He uenged,
Quen fourferde alle the flesch that He formed hade.
Hym rwed that He hem vprerde & raght hem lyflode;
& efte that He hem vndyd, hard hit Hym thoght.
For quen the swemande sorghe soght to His hert,
He knyt a couenaunde cortaysly with monkynde there,
In the mesure of His mode & methe of His wylle,
that He schulde neuer for no syt smyte al at onez,
As to quelle alle quykez for qued that myght falle,
Whyl of the lenthe of the londe lastez the terme.
that ilke skyl for no scathe ascaped Hym neuer.
Wheder wonderly He wrak on wykked men after,
Ful felly for that ilk faute forferde a kyth ryche,
In the anger of His ire, that arghed mony;
& al watz for this ilk euel, that vnhappen glette,

Alle illez He hates as helle that alle stynkkez;
Bot non nuyez Hym on naght ne neuer vpon dayez
As harlottrye vnhonest, hethyng of seluen:
that schamez for no schrewedschyp, schent mot he worthe.
Bot sauyour, mon, in thyself, thaghthou a sotte lyuie,
thaghthou bere thyself babel, bythenk the sumtyme
Whether He that stykked vche a stare in vche steppe yghe,
ghif Hymsel[f] be bore blynde hit is a brod wonder;
& He that fetly in face fettled alle eres,
If he hatz losed the lysten hit lyftez meruayle:
Trave thou neuer that tale, vntrwe thou hit fyndez.
ther is no dede so derne that dittez His yghen;
ther is no wyghe in his werk so war ne so stylle
that hit ne thrawez to Hym thr[o] er he hit thoght haue.
For He is the gropande God, the grounde of alle dedez,
Rypande of vche a ring the reynyez & hert.
& there He fyndez al fayre a freke wythinne,
that hert honest & hol, that hathel He honourez,
Sendez hym a sad syght: to se His auen face,
& harde honysez thise other, & of His erde flemez.
Bot of the dome of the douthe for dedez of schame,
He is so skoymos of that skathe, He scarrez bylyue;
He may not dryghe to draw allyt, bot drepez in hast:
& that watz schewed schortly by a scathe onez.
Olde Abraham in erde onez he syttez
Euen byfore his hous-dore, vnder an oke grene;
Bryght blykked the bem of the brode heuen;
In the hyghe hete therof Abraham bidez:
He watz schunt to the schadow vnder schyre leuez.
thenne watz he war on the waye of wlonk Wyghez thrynne;
If thay wer farande & fre & fayre to beholde
Hit is ethe to leue by the last ende.
For the lede that ther laye the leuez anvnder,
When he hade of Hem syght he hyghez bylyue,
& as to God the goodmon gos Hem agaynez
& haylsed Hem in onhede, & sayde: 'Hende Lorde,
ghif euer thy mon vpon molde merit disserued,
Lenge a lyttel with thy lede, I loghly biseche;
Passe neuer fro thi pouere, ghif I hit pray durst,
Er thou haf biden with thi burne & vnder boghe restted,
& I schal wynne Yow wyght of water a lyttel,
& fast aboute schal I fare Your fette wer waschene.
Resttez here on this rote & I schal rachche after

'Fare forthe,' quoth the Frekez, '& fech as thou seggez;
By bole of this brode tre We byde the here.'
thenne orppedly into his hous he hyghed to Sare,
Commaunded hir to be cof & quyk at this onez:
'thre mettez of mele menge & ma kakez;
Vnder askez ful hote happe hem byliue;
Quyl I fete sumquat fat, thou the fyr bete,
Prestly at this ilke poynte sum polment to make.'
He cached to his covhous & a calf bryngez,
that watz tender & not toghe, bed tyrue of the hyde,
& sayde to his seruaunt that hit sethe faste;
& he deruely at his dome dyght hit bylyue.
the burne to be bare-heued buskez hym thenne,
Clechez to a clene clothe & kestez on the grene,

& bryngez butter wythal & by the bred settez;
Mete messez of mylke he merkkez bytwene,
Sythen potage & polment in plater honest.
As sewer in a god assyse he serued Hem fayre,
Wyth sadde semblaunt & swete of such as he hade;
& God as a glad gest mad god chere

Abraham, al hodlez, with armez vp-folden,
Mynystred mete byfore tho Men that myghtes al weldez.
thenne thay sayden as thay sete samen alle thrynne,
When the mete watz remued & thay of mensk speken,
'I schal efte hereaway, Abram,' thay sayden,
'ghet er thy lyuez lyght lethe vpon erthe,
& thenne schal Sare consayue & a sun bere,
that schal be Abrahamez ayre & after hym wynne
With wele & wyth worschyp the worthely peple

thenne the burde byhynde the dor for busmar laghed;
& sayde sothly to hirself Sare the madde:
'May thou traw for tykle that thou tonne moghtez,
& I so hyghe out of age, & also my lorde?'
For sothely, as says the wryt, he wern of sadde elde,
Bothe the wyghe & his wyf, such werk watz hem fayled
Fro mony a brod day byfore; ho barayn ay byene,
that selue Sare, withouten sede into that same tyme.
thenne sayde oure Syre ther He sete: 'Se! so Sare laghes,
Not trawande the tale that I the to schewed.
Hopez ho oght may be harde My hondez to work?
& ghet I avow verayly the avaunt that I made;
I schal gheply aghayn & ghelde that I hyght,
& sothely send to Sare a soun & an hayre.'
thenne swenged forth Sare & swer by hir trawthe
that for lot that thay laused ho laghed neuer.
'Now innoghe: hit is not so,' thenne nurned the Dryghtyn,
'For thou laghed alogh, bot let we hit one.'
With that thay ros vp radly, as thay rayke schulde,
& setten toward Sodamas Her syght alle at onez;
For that cite therbysyde watz sette in a vale,
No mylez fro Mambre mo then tweyne,
Whereso wonyed this ilke wygh, that wendez with oure Lorde
For to tent Hym with tale & teche Hym the gate.
then glydez forth God; the godmon Hym folghez;
Abraham heldez Hem wyth, Hem to conueye
In towarde the cety of Sodamas that synned had thenne
In the faute of this fylthe. the Fader hem thretes,
& sayde thus to the segg that sued Hym after:
'How myght I hyde Myn hert fro Habraham the trwe,
that I ne dyscouered to his corse My counsayl so dere,
Sythen he is chosen to be chef chyldryn fader,
that so folk schal falle fro to flete alle the worlde,
& vche blod in that burne blessed schal worthe?
Me bos telle to that tolk the tene of My wylle,
& alle Myn atlyng to Abraham vnhaspe bilyue.
The grete soun of Sodamas synkkez in Myn erez,
& the gult of Gomorre garez Me to wrath.
I schal lyght into that led & loke Myseluen
[If] thay haf don as the dyne dryuez on lofte.
thay han lerned a lyst that lykez me ille,
that thay han founden in her flesch of fautez the werst:
Vch male matz his mach a man as hymseluen,
& fylter folyly in fere on femmalez wyse.
I compast hem a kynde crafte & kende hit hem derne,
& amed hit in Myn ordenaunce oddely dere,
& dyght drwry therinne, doole alther-swettest,
& the play of paramorez I portrayed Myseluen,
& made therto a maner myriest of other:
When two true togeder had tyghed hemseluen,
Bytwene a male & his make such merthe schulde conne,
Welnyghe pure paradys moght preue no better;
Ellez thay moght honestly ayther other welde,
At a stylle stollen steuen, vnstered wyth syght,
Luf-lowe hem bytwene lasched so hote
that alle the meschefez on mold moght hit not sleke.
Now haf thay skyfted My skyl & scorned natwre,
& henttez hem in hethyng an vsage vnclene.
Hem to smyte for that smod smartly I thenk,
that wyghez schal be by hem war, worlde withouten ende.'
thenne arghed Abraham & alle his mod chaunge[d],
For hope of the harde hate that hyght hatz oure Lorde.
Al sykande he sayde: 'Sir, with Yor leue,
Schal synful & saklez suffer al on payne?
Wether euer hit lyke my Lorde to lyfte such domez
that the wykked & the worthy schal on wrake suffer,
& weye vpon the worre half that wrathed the neuer?
that watz neuer thy won that wroghtez vus alle.
Now fyfty fyn frendez wer founde in ghonde toune,
In the cety of Sodamas & also Gomorre,
that neuer lakked thy laue, bot loued ay trauthe,
& reghtful wern & resounable & redy the to serue,
Schal thay falle in the faute that other frekez wroght,
& joyne to her juggement, her juise to haue?
that nas neuer thyn note, vnneuened hit worthe,
that art so gaynly a God & of goste mylde.'
'Nay, for fyfty,' quoth the Fader, '& thy fayre speche,
& thay be founden in that folk of her fylthe clene,
I schal forgyue alle the gylt thurghMy grace one,
& let hem smolt al unsmyten smothely at onez.'
'Aa! blessed be thow,' quoth the burne, 'so boner & thewed,
& al haldez in thy honde, the heuen & the erthe;
Bot, for I haf this talke tatz to non ille
ghif I mele a lyttel more that mul am & askez.
What if fyue faylen of fyfty the noumbre,
& the remnaunt be reken, how restes thy wylle?'
'And fyue wont of fyfty,' quoth God, 'I schal forghete alle

'& quat if faurty be fre & fauty thyse other:
Schalt thow schortly al schende & schape non other?'
'Nay, thaghfaurty forfete, ghet fryst I a whyle,
& voyde away My vengaunce, thaghMe vyl thynk.'
then Abraham obeched Hym & loghly Him thonkkez:
'Now sayned be thou, Sauiour, so symple in thy wrath!
I am bot erthe ful euel & vsle so blake,
For to mele wyth such a Mayster as myghtez hatz alle.
Bot I haue bygonnen wyth my God, & He hit gayn thynkez;
ghif I forloyne as a fol thy fraunchyse may serue.
What if thretty thryuande be thrad in ghon tounez,
What schal I leue of my Lorde, [i]f He hem lethe wolde?'
thenne the godlych God gef hym onsware:
'ghet for thretty in throng I schal My thro steke,
& spare spakly of spyt in space of My thewez,
& My rankor refrayne four thy reken wordez.'
'What for twenty,' quoth the tolke, 'vntwynez thou hem thenne?'
'Nay, ghif thou ghernez hit ghet, ghark I hem grace;
If that twenty be trwe, I tene hem no more,
Bot relece alle that regioun of her ronk werkkez.'
'Now, athel Lorde,' quoth Abraham, 'onez a speche,
& I schal schape no more tho schalkkez to helpe.
If ten trysty in toune be tan in thi werkkez,
Wylt thou mese thy mode & menddyng abyde?'
'I graunt,' quoth the grete God, 'Graunt mercy,' that other;
& thenne arest the renk & raght no fyrre.
& Godde glydez His gate by those grene wayez,
& he conueyen Hym con with cast of his yghe;
& als he loked along thereas oure Lorde passed,
ghet he cryed Hym after with careful steuen:
'Meke Mayster, on thy mon to mynne if the lyked,
Loth lengez in ghon leede that is my lef brother;
He syttez ther in Sodomis, thy seruaunt so pouere,
Among tho mansed men that han the much greued.
ghif thou tynez that toun, tempre thyn yre,
As thy mersy may malte, thy meke to spare.'
then he wendez, wendez his way, wepande for care,
Towarde the mere of Mambre, wepande for sorewe;
& there in longyng al nyght he lengez in wones,
Whyl the Souerayn to Sodamas sende to spye.
His sondes into Sodamas watz sende in that tyme,
In that ilk euentyde, by aungels tweyne,
Meuand meuande mekely togeder as myry men ghonge,
As Loot in a loge dor lened hym alone,
In a porche of that place pyght to the ghates,
that watz ryal & ryche so watz the renkes seluen.
As he stared into the strete ther stout men played,
He syghe ther swey in asent swete men tweyne;
Bolde burnez wer thay bothe with berdles chynnez,
Ryol rollande fax to raw sylk lyke,
Of ble as the brere-flour whereso the bare scheweed.
Ful clene watz the countenaunce of her cler yghen;
Wlonk whit watz her wede & wel hit hem semed.
Of alle feturez ful fyn & fautlez bothe;
Watz non autly in outher, for aungels hit wern,
& that the ghep vnderghede that in the ghate syttez;
He ros vp ful radly & ran hem to mete,
& loghe he loutez hem to, Loth, to the grounde,
& sythen soberly: 'Syrez, I yow byseche

Comez to your knaues kote, I craue at this onez;
I schal fette yow a fatte your fette for to wasche;

& thay nay that thay nolde neghno howsez,
Bot stylly ther in the strete as thay stadde wern
thay wolde lenge the long naght & logge theroute:
Hit watz hous innoghe to hem the heuen vpon lofte.
Loth lathed so longe wyth luflych wordez

His two dere doghterez deuoutly hem haylsed,
that wer maydenez ful meke, maryed not ghet,
& thay wer semly & swete, & swythe wel arayed.
Loth thenne ful lyghtly lokez hym aboute,
& his men amonestes mete for to dyght:
'Bot thenkkez on hit be threfte what thynk so ghe make,
For wyth no sour no no salt seruez hym neuer.'
Bot ghet I wene that the wyf hit wroth to dyspyt,
& sayde softely to hirself: 'this vn[s]auere hyne
Louez no salt in her sauce; ghet hit no skyl were

thenne ho sauerez with salt her seuez vchone,
Agayne the bone of the burne that hit forboden hade,
& als ho scelt hem in scorne that wel her skyl knewen.
Why watz ho, wrech, so wod? Ho wrathed oure Lorde.
thenne seten thay at the soper, wern serued bylyue,
the gestes gay & ful glad, of glam debonere,
Welawynnely wlonk, tyl thay waschen hade,

Fro the seggez haden souped & seten bot a whyle,
Er euer thay bosked to bedde, the borghwatz al vp,
Alle that weppen myght welde, the wakker & the stronger,
To vmbelyghe Lothez hous the ledez to take.
In grete flokkez of folk thay fallen to his ghatez;
As a scowte-wach scarred so the asscry rysed;
With kene clobbez of that clos thay clatz on the wowez,
& wyth a schrylle scarp schout thay schewe thyse worde[z]:
'If thou louyez thy lyf, Loth, in thyse wones,
ghete vus out those ghong men that ghore-whyle here entred,
that we may lere hym of lof, as oure lyst biddez,
As is the asyse of Sodomas to seggez that passen.'
Whatt! thay sputen & speken of so spitous fylthe,
What! thay gheghed & gholped of ghestande sorghe,
that ghet the wynd & the weder & the worlde stynkes
Of the brych that vpbraydez those brothelych wordez.
the godman glyfte with that glam & gloped for noyse;
So scharpe schame to hym schot, he schrank at the hert.
For he knew the costoum that kythed those wrechez,
He doted neuer for no doel so depe in his mynde.
'Allas!' sayd hym thenne Loth, & lyghtly he rysez,
& bowez forth fro the bench into the brode ghates.
What! he wonded no wothe of wekked knauez,
that he ne passed the port the p[er]il to abide.
He went forthe at the wyket & waft hit hym after,
that a clyket hit cleght clos hym byhynde.
thenne he meled to tho men mesurable wordez,
For harlotez with his hendelayk he hoped to chast:
'Oo, my frendez so fre, your fare is to strange;
Dotz away your derf dyn & derez neuer my gestes.
Avoy! hit is your vylaynye, ghe vylen yourseluen;
& ghe are jolyf gentylmen, your japez ar ille
Bot I schal kenne yow by kynde a crafte that is better:
I haf a tresor in my telde of tow my fayre deghter,

In Sodamas, thaghI hit say, non semloker burdes;
Hit arn ronk, hit arn rype, & redy to manne;
To samen wyth tho semly the solace is better.
I schal biteche yow tho two that tayt arn & quoynt,
& laykez wyth hem as yow lyst, & letez my gestes one.'
thenne the rebaudez so ronk rerd such a noyse
that aghly hurled in his erez her harlotez speche:
'Wost thou not wel that thou wonez here a wyghe strange,
An outcomlyng, a carle? We kylle of thyn heued!
Who joyned the be jostyse oure japez to blame,

thus thay throbled & throng & thrwe vmbe his erez,
& distresed hym wonder strayt with strenkthe in the prece,
Bot that the ghonge men, so ghepe, ghornen theroute,
Wapped vpon the wyket & wonnen hem tylle,
& by the hondez hym hent & horyed hym withinne,
& steken the ghates ston-harde wyth stalworth barrez.
thay blwe a boffet inblande that banned peple,
that thay blustered, as blynde as Bayard watz euer;
thay lest of Lotez logging any lysoun to fynde,
Bot nyteled ther alle the nyght for noght at the last.
thenne vch tolke tyght hem, that hade of tayt fayled,
& vchon rotheled to the rest that he reche moght;
Bot thay wern wakned al wrank that ther in won lenged,
Of on the vglokest vnhap that euer on erd suffred.
Ruddon of the day-rawe ros vpon vghten,
When merk of the mydnyght moght no more last.
Ful erly those aungelez this hathel thay ruthen,
& glopnedly on Godez halue gart hym vpryse;
Fast the freke ferkez vp ful ferd at his hert;
thay comaunded hym cof to cach that he hade,
'Wyth thy wyf & thy wyghez & thy wlonc deghtters,
For we lathe the, sir Loth, that thou thy lyf haue.
Cayre tid of this kythe er combred thou worthe,
With alle thi here vpon haste, tyl thou a hil fynde;
Foundez faste on your fete; bifore your face lokes,
Bot bes neuer so bolde to blusch yow bihynde,

Til ghe reche to a reset, rest ghe neuer.
For we schal tyne this toun & traythely disstrye,
Wyth alle thise wyghez so wykke wyghtly devoyde,

Sodomas schal ful sodenly synk into grounde,

& vche a koste of this kythe clater vpon hepes.'
then laled Loth: 'Lorde, what is best?
If I me fele vpon fote that I fle moght,
Hov schulde I huyde me fro H[y]m that hatz His hate kynned
In the brath of His breth that brennez alle thinkez?
To crepe fro my Creatour & know not wheder,
Ne whether His fooschip me folghez bifore other bihynde.'
the freke sayde: 'No foschip oure Fader hatz the schewed,
Bot highly heuened thi hele fro hem that arn combred.
Nov wale the a wonnyng that the warisch myght,
& He schal saue hit for thy sake that hatz vus sende hider,
For thou art oddely thyn one out of this fylthe,

'Lorde, loued He worthe,' quoth Loth, 'vpon erthe!
then is a cite herbisyde that Segor hit hatte,
Here vtter on a rounde hil hit houez hit one.
I wolde, if His wylle wore, to that won scape.'
'thenn fare forth,' quoth that fre, '& fyne thou neuer,
With those ilk that thow wylt that threnge the after,
& ay goande on your gate, wythouten agayn-tote,
For alle this londe schal be lorne longe er the sonne rise.'
the wyghe wakened his wyf & his wlonk deghteres,
& other two myri men tho maydenez schulde wedde;
& thay token hit as tyt & tented hit lyttel;
thaghfast lathed hem Loth, thay leghen ful stylle.
the aungelez hasted thise other & aghly hem thratten,
& enforsed alle fawre forth at the ghatez:

thise aungelez hade hem by hande out at the ghatez,
Prechande hem the perile, & beden hem passe fast:
'Lest ghe be taken in the teche of tyrauntez here,
Loke ghe bowe now bi bot; bowez fast hence!'
& thay kayre ne con, & kenely flowen.

To wakan wederez so wylde; the wyndez He callez,

Fro fawre half of the folde flytande loude.
Clowdez clustered bytwene kesten vp torres,

Of felle flaunkes of fyr & flakes of soufre,
Al in smolderande smoke smachande ful ille,

Al birolled wyth the rayn, rostted & brenned,

For when that the Helle herde the houndez of heuen,

the grete barrez of the abyme he barst vp at onez,
that alle the regioun torof in riftes ful grete,
& clouen alle in lyttel cloutes the clyffez aywhere,
As lauce leuez of the boke that lepes in twynne.

Al tho citees & her sydes sunkken to helle.
Rydelles wern tho grete rowtes of renkkes withinne,
When thay wern war of the wrake that no wyghe achaped;
Such a ghomerly gharm of ghellyng ther rysed,
therof clatered the cloudes, that Kryst myght haf rawthe.
the segge herde that soun to Segor that ghede,
& the wenches hym wyth that by the way folghed;
Ferly ferde watz her flesch that flowen ay ilyche,
Trynande ay a hyghe trot, that torne neuer dorsten.
Loth & tho luly-whit, his lefly two deghter,
Ay folghed here face, bifore her bothe yghen;
Bot the balleful burde, that neuer bode keped,
Blusched byhynden her bak that bale for to herkken.
Hit watz lusty Lothes wyf that ouer he[r] lyfte schulder

Tyl thay in Segor wern sette, & sayned our Lorde;
Wyth lyght louez vplyfte thay loued Hym swythe,
that so His seruauntes wolde see & saue of such wothe.
Al watz dampped & don & drowned by thenne;

Into that malscrande mere, marred bylyue,

For his make watz myst, that on the mount lenged
In a stonen statue that salt sauor habbes,
For two fautes that the fol watz founde in mistrauthe:
On, ho serued at the soper salt bifore Dryghtyn,
& sythen, ho blusched hir bihynde, thaghhir forboden were;
For on ho standes a ston, & salt for that other,
& alle lyst on hir lik that arn on launde bestes.
Abraham ful erly watz vp on the morne,
that alle naght much niye hade no mon in his hert,
Al in longing for Loth leyen in a wache;
ther he lafte hade oure Lorde he is on lofte wonnen;
He sende toward Sodomas the syght of his yghen,
that euer hade ben an erde of erthe the swettest,
As aparaunt to paradis, that plantted the Dryghtyn;
Nov is hit plunged in a pit like of pich fylled.
Suche a rothun of a reche ros fro the blake,
Askez vpe in the arye & vsellez ther flowen,
As a fornes ful of flot that vpon fyr boyles
When bryght brennande brondez ar bet theranvnder.
this watz a uengaunce violent that voyded thise places,
that foundered hatz so fayr a folk & the folde sonkken.
ther the fyue citees wern set nov is a see called,
that ay is drouy & dym, & ded in hit kynde,
Blo, blubrande, & blak, vnblythe to neghe;
As a stynkande stanc that stryed synne,
that euer of synne & of smach smart is to fele.
Forthy the derk Dede See hit is demed euermore,
For hit dedez of dethe duren there ghet;
For hit is brod & bothemlez, & bitter as the galle,
& noght may lenge in that lake that any lyf berez,
& alle the costez of kynde hit combrez vchone.
For lay theron a lump of led, & hit on loft fletez,
& folde theron a lyght fyther, & hit to founs synkkez;
& ther water may walter to wete any erthe

If any schalke to be schent wer schowued therinne,

& neuer dryghe no dethe to dayes of ende.
& as hit is corsed of kynde & hit coostez als,
the clay that clenges therby arn corsyes strong,
As alum & alkaran, that angre arn bothe,
Soufre sour & saundyuer, & other such mony;
& ther waltez of that water in waxlokes grete

& the fayrest fryt that may on folde growe,
As orenge & other fryt & apple-garnade,

As any dom myght deuice of dayntyez oute;
Bot quen hit is brused other broken, other byten in twynne,
No worldez goud hit wythinne, bot wyndowande askes.
Alle thyse ar teches & tokenes to trow vpon ghet,
& wittnesse of that wykked werk, & the wrake after
that oure Fader forferde for fylthe of those ledes.
thenne vch wyghe may wel wyt that He the wlonk louies;
& if He louyes clene layk that is oure Lorde ryche,
& to be couthe in His courte thou coueytes thenne,
To se that Semly in sete & His swete face,
Clerrer counseyl, counseyl con I non, bot that thou clene worthe.
For Clopyngnel in the compas of his clene Rose,
ther he expounez a speche to hym that spede wolde
Of a lady to be loued: 'Loke to hir sone
Of wich beryng that ho be, & wych ho best louyes,
& be ryght such in vch a borghe of body & of dedes,
& folghthe fet of that fere that thou fre haldes;
& if thou wyrkkes on this wyse, thaghho wyk were,
Hir schal lyke that layk that lyknes hir tylle.'
If thou wyl dele drwrye wyth Dryghtyn thenne,
& lelly louy thy Lorde & His leef worthe,
thenne confourme the to Kryst, & the clene make,
that euer is polyced als playn as the perle seluen.
For, loke, fro fyrst that He lyght withinne the lel mayden,
By how comly a kest He watz clos there,
When venkkyst watz no vergynyte, ne vyolence maked,
Bot much clener watz hir corse, God kynned therinne.
& efte when He borne watz in Bethelen the ryche,
In wych puryte thay departed; thaghthay pouer were,
Watz neuer so blysful a bour as watz a bos thenne,
Ne no schroude hous so schene as a schepon thare,
Ne non so glad vnder God as ho that grone schulde.
For ther watz seknesse al sounde that sarrest is halden,
& ther watz rose reflayr where rote hatz ben euer,
& ther watz solace & songe wher sorghhatz ay cryed;
For aungelles with instrumentes of organes & pypes,
& rial ryngande rotes & the reken fythel,
& alle hende that honestly moght an hert glade,
Aboutte my lady watz lent quen ho delyuer were.
thenne watz her blythe Barne burnyst so clene
that bothe the ox & the asse Hym hered at ones;
thay knewe Hym by His clannes for Kyng of nature,
For non so clene of such a clos com neuer er thenne.
& ghif clanly He thenne com, ful cortays therafter,
that alle that longed to luther ful lodly He hated,
By nobleye of His norture He nolde neuer towche
Oght that watz vngoderly other ordure watz inne.
ghet comen lodly to that Lede, as lazares monye,
Summe lepre, summe lome, & lomerande blynde,
Poysened, & parlatyk, & pyned in fyres,
Drye folk & ydropike, & dede at the laste,
Alle called on that Cortayse & claymed His grace.
He heled hem wyth hynde speche of that thay ask after,
For whatso He towched also tyd tourned to hele,
Wel clanner then any crafte cowthe devyse.
So clene watz His hondelyng vche ordure hit schonied,
& the gropyng so goud of God & Man bothe,
that for fetys of His fyngeres fonded He neuer
Nauther to cout ne to kerue with knyf ne wyth egge;
Forthy brek He the bred blades wythouten,
For hit ferde freloker in fete in His fayre honde,
Displayed more pryuyly when He hit part schulde,
thenne alle the toles of Tolowse moght tyght hit to kerue.
thus is He kyryous & clene that thou His cort askes:
Hov schulde thou com to His kyth bot if thou clene were?
Nov ar we sore & synful & sovly vchone;
How schulde we se, then may we say, that Syre vpon throne?
ghis, that Mayster is mercyable, thaghthou be man fenny,
& al tomarred in myre whyle thou on molde lyuyes;
thou may schyne thurghschryfte, thaghthou haf schome serued,
& pure the with penaunce tyl thou a perle worthe.
Perle praysed is prys ther perre is schewed,
thaghhym not derrest be demed to dele for penies.
Quat may the cause be called bot for hir clene hwes,
that wynnes worschyp abof alle whyte stones?
For ho schynes so schyr that is of schap rounde,
Wythouten faut other fylthe ghif ho fyn were,
& wax euer in the worlde in weryng so olde,
ghet the perle payres not whyle ho in pyese lasttes;
& if hit cheue the chaunce vncheryst ho worthe,
that ho blyndes of ble in bour ther ho lygges,
Nobot wasch hir wyth wourchyp in wyn as ho askes,
Ho by kynde schal becom clerer then are.
So if folk be defowled by vnfre chaunce,
that he be sulped in sawle, seche to schryfte,
& he may polyce hym at the prest, by penaunce taken,
Wel bryghter then the beryl other browden perles.
Bot war the wel, if thou be waschen wyth water of schryfte,
& polysed als playn as parchmen schauen,
Sulp no more thenne in synne thy saule therafter,
For thenne thou Dryghtyn dyspleses with dedes ful sore,
& entyses Hym to tene more traythly then euer,
& wel hatter to hate then hade thou no waschen.
For when a sawele is saghtled & sakred to Dryghtyn,
He holly haldes hit His & haue hit He wolde;
thenne efte lastes hit likkes, He loses hit ille,
As hit were rafte wyth vnryght & robbed wyth thewes.
War the thenne for the wrake: His wrath is achaufed
For that that ones watz His schulde efte be vnclene,
thaghhit be bot a bassyn, a bolle other a scole,
A dysche other a dobler, that Dryghtyn onez serued.
To defowle hit euer vpon folde fast He forbedes,
So is He scoymus of scathe that scylful is euer.
& that watz bared in Babyloyn in Baltazar tyme,
Hov harde vnhap ther hym hent & hastyly sone,
For he the vesselles avyled that vayled in the temple
In seruyse of the Souerayn sumtyme byfore.
ghif ghe wolde tyght me a tom telle hit I wolde,
Hov charged more watz his chaunce that hem cherych nolde
then his fader forloyne that feched hem wyth strenthe,
& robbed the relygioun of relykes alle.
Danyel in his dialokez devysed sumtyme,
As ghet is proued expresse in his profecies,
Hov the gentryse of Juise & Jherusalem the ryche
Watz disstryed wyth distres, & drawen to the erthe.
For that folke in her fayth watz founden vntrwe,
that haden hyght the hyghe God to halde of Hym euer;
& He hem halghed for His & help at her nede
In mukel meschefes mony, that meruayl [is] to here.
& thay forloyne her fayth & folghed other goddes,
& that wakned His wrath & wrast hit so hyghe
that He fylsened the faythful in the falce lawe
To forfare the falce in the faythe trwe.
Hit watz sen in that sythe that Zedethyas rengned
In Juda, that justised the Juyne kynges.
He sete on Salamones solie on solemne wyse,
Bot of leaute he watz lat to his Lorde hende:
He vsed abominaciones of idolatrye,
& lette lyght bi the lawe that he watz lege tylle.
Forthi oure Fader vpon folde a foman hym wakned:
Nabigodenozar nuyed hym swythe.
He pursued into Palastyn with proude men mony,
& ther he wast wyth with werre the wones of thorpes;
He herghed vp alle Israel & hent of the beste,
& the gentylest of Judee in Jerusalem biseged,
Vmbewalt alle the walles wyth wyghes ful stronge,
At vche a dor a doghty duk, & dutte hem wythinne;
For the borghwatz so bygge baytayled alofte,
& stoffed wythinne with stout men to stalle hem theroute.
thenne watz the sege sette the cete aboute,
Skete skarmoch skelt, much skathe lached;
At vch brugge a berfray on basteles wyse
that seuen sythe vch a day asayled the ghates;
Trwe tulkkes in toures teueled wythinne,
In bigge brutage of borde bulde on the walles;
thay feght & thay fende of, & fylter togeder
Til two gher ouertorned, ghet tok thay hit neuer.
At the laste, vpon longe, tho ledes wythinne,
Faste fayled hem the fode, enfannined monie;
the hote hunger wythinne hert hem wel sarre
then any dunt of that douthe that dowelled theroute.
thenne wern tho rowtes redles in tho ryche wones;
Fro that mete watz myst, megre thay wexen,
& thay stoken so strayt that thay ne stray myght
A fote fro that forselet to forray no goudes.
thenne the kyng of the kyth a counsayl hym takes
Wyth the best of his burnes, a blench for to make;
thay stel out on a stylle nyght er any steuen rysed,
& harde hurles thurghthe oste er enmies hit wyste.
Bot er thay atwappe ne moght the wach wythoute
Highe skelt watz the askry the skewes anvnder.
Loude alarom vpon launde lulted watz thenne;
Ryche, ruthed of her rest, ran to here wedes,
Hard hattes thay hent & on hors lepes;
Cler claryoun crak cryed on lofte.
By that watz alle on a hepe hurlande swythee,
Folghande that other flote, & fonde hem bilyue,
Ouertok hem as tyd, tult hem of sadeles,
Tyl vche prynce hade his per put to the grounde.
& ther watz the kyng kaght wyth Calde prynces,
& alle hise gentyle forjusted on Jerico playnes,
& presented wern as presoneres to the prynce rychest,
Nabigodenozar, noble in his chayer;
& he the faynest freke that he his fo hade,
& speke spitously hem to, & spylt therafter.
the kynges sunnes in his syght he slow euervch one,
& holkked out his auen yghen heterly bothe,
& bede the burne to be broght to Babyloyn the ryche,
& there in dongoun be don to dreghe ther his wyrdes.
Now se, so the Soueray[n] set hatz His wrake:
Nas hit not for Nabugo ne his noble nauther
that other depryued watz of pryde with paynes stronge,
Bot for his beryng so badde agayn his blythe Lorde;
For hade the Fader ben his frende, that hym bifore keped,
Ne neuer trespast to Him in teche of mysseleue,
To colde wer alle Calde & kythes of Ynde,
ghet take Torkye hem wyth, her tene hade ben little.
ghet nolde neuer Nabugo this ilke note leue
Er he hade tuyred this toun & torne hit to grounde.
He joyned vnto Jerusalem a gentyle duc thenne,
His name watz Nabuzardan, to noye the Jues;
He watz mayster of his men & myghty himseluen,
the chef of his cheualrye his chekkes to make;
He brek the bareres as bylyue, & the burghafter,
& enteres in ful ernestly, in yre of his hert.
What! the maysterry watz mene: the men wern away,
the best boghed wyth the burne that the borghghemed,
& tho that byden wer [s]o biten with the bale hunger
that on wyf hade ben worthe the welgest fourre.
Nabizardan noght forthy nolde not spare,
Bot bede al to the bronde vnder bare egge;
thay slowen of swettest semlych burdes,
Bathed barnes in blod & her brayn spylled;
Prestes & prelates thay presed to dethe,
Wyues & wenches her wombes tocoruen,
that her boweles outborst aboute the diches,
& al watz carfully kylde that thay cach myght.
And alle swypped, vnswolghed of the sworde kene,
thay wer cagged & kaght on capeles al bare,
Festned fettres to her fete vnder fole wombes,
& brothely broght to Babyloyn ther bale to suffer,
To sytte in seruage & syte, that sumtyme wer gentyle.
Now ar chaunged to chorles & charged wyth werkkes,
Bothe to cayre at the kart & the kuy mylke,
that sumtyme sete in her sale syres & burdes.
& ghet Nabuzardan nyl neuer stynt
Er he to the tempple tee wyth his tulkkes alle;
Betes on the barers, brestes vp the ghates,
Slouen alle at a slyp that serued therinne,
Pulden prestes bi the polle & plat of her hedes,
Dighten dekenes to dethe, dungen doun clerkkes,
& alle the maydenes of the munster maghtyly hokyllen
Wyth the swayf of the sworde that swolghed hem alle.
thenne ran thay to the relykes as robbors wylde,
& pyled alle the apparement that pented to the kyrke,
the pure pyleres of bras pourtrayd in golde,
& the chef chaundeler charged with the lyght,
that ber the lamp vpon lofte that lemed euermore
Bifore th[e] sancta sanctorumther selcouth watz ofte.
thay caght away that condelstik, & the crowne als
that the auter hade vpon, of athel golde ryche,
the gredirne & the goblotes garnyst of syluer,
the bases of the bryght postes & bassynes so schyre,
Dere disches of golde & dubleres fayre,
the vyoles & the vesselment of vertuous stones.
Now hatz Nabuzardan nomen alle thyse noble thynges,
& pyled that precious place & pakked those godes;
the golde of the gazafylace to swythe gret noumbre,
Wyth alle the vrnmentes of that hous, he hamppred togeder;
Alle he spoyled spitously in a sped whyle
that Salomon so mony a sadde gher soght to make.
Wyth alle the coyntyse that he cowthe clene to wyrke,
Deuised he the vesselment, the vestures clene;
Wyth slyght of his ciences, his Souerayn to loue,
the hous & the anournementes he hyghtled togedere.
Now hatz Nabuzardan numnend hit al samen,
& sythen bet doun the burgh& brend hit in askes.
thenne wyth legiounes of ledes ouer londes he rydes,
Herghez of Israel the hyrne aboute;
Wyth charged chariotes the cheftayn he fynde,
Bikennes the catel to the kyng, that he caght hade;
Presented him the prisoneres in pray that thay token,
Moni a worthly wyghe whil her worlde laste,
Moni semly syre soun, & swythe rych maydenes,
the pruddest of the prouince, & prophetes childer,
As Ananie & Azarie & als Mizael,
& dere Daniel also, that watz deuine noble,
With moni a modey moder-chylde mo then innoghe.
& Nabugo_de_nozar makes much joye,
Nov he the kyng hatz conquest & the kyth wunnen,
& dreped alle the doghtyest & derrest in armes,
& the lederes of her lawe layd to the grounde,
& the pryce of the profetie prisoners maked.
Bot the joy of the juelrye so gentyle & ryche,
When hit watz schewed hym so schene, scharp watz his wonder;
Of such vessel auayed, that vayled so huge,
Neuer ghet nas Nabugo_de_nozar er thenne.
He sesed hem with solemnete, the Souerayn he praysed
that watz athel ouer alle, Israel Dryghtyn:
Such god, such gomes, such gay vesselles,
Comen neuer out of kyth to Caldee reames.
He trussed hem in his tresorye in a tryed place,
Rekenly, wyth reuerens, as he ryght hade;
& ther he wroght as the wyse, as ghe may wyt hereafter,
For hade he let of hem lyght, hym moght haf lumpen worse.
that ryche in gret rialte rengned his lyue,
As conquerour of vche a cost he cayser watz hatte,
Emperour of alle the erthe & also the saudan,
& als the god of the grounde watz grauen his name.
& al thurghdome of Daniel, fro he deuised hade
that alle goudes com of God, & gef hit hym bi samples,
that he ful clanly bicnv his carp bi the laste,
& ofte hit mekned his mynde, his maysterful werkkes.
Bot al drawes to dyghe with doel vp[o]n ende:
Bi a hathel neuer so hyghe, he heldes to grounde.
& so Nabugo_de_nozar, as he nedes moste,
For alle his empire so highe in erthe is he grauen.
Bot thenn the bolde Baltazar, that watz his barn aldest,
He watz stalled in his stud, & stabled the rengne
In the burghof Babiloyne, the biggest he trawed,
that nauther in heuen ne [on] erthe hade no pere;
For he bigan in alle the glori that hym the gome lafte,
Nabugo_de_nozar, that watz his noble fader.
So kene a kyng in Caldee com neu[er] er thenne;
Bot honoured he not Hym that in heuen wonies.
Bot fals fantummes of fendes, formed with handes,
Wyth tool out of harde tre, & telded on lofte,
& of stokkes & stones, he stoute goddes callz,
When thay ar gilde al with golde & gered wyth syluer;
& there he kneles & callez & clepes after help.
& thay reden him ryght rewarde he hem hetes,
& if thay gruchen him his grace, to gremen his hert,
He cleches to a gret klubbe & knokkes hem to peces.
thus in pryde & olipraunce his empyre he haldes,
In lust & in lecherye & lothelych werkkes,
& hade a wyf for to welde, a worthelych quene,
& mony a lemman, neuer the later, that ladis wer called.
In the clernes of his concubines & curious wedez,
In notyng of nwe metes & of nice gettes,
Al watz the mynde of that man on misschapen thinges,
Til the Lorde of the lyfte liste hit abate.
Thenne this bolde Baltazar bithenkkes hym ones
To vouche on avayment of his vayne g[l]orie;
Hit is not innoghe to the nice al noghty think vse
Bot if alle the worlde wyt his wykked dedes.
Baltazar thurghBabiloyn his banne gart crye,
& thurghthe cuntre of Caldee his callyng con spryng,
that alle the grete vpon grounde schulde geder hem samen
& assemble at a set day at the saudans fest.
Such a mangerie to make the man watz auised,
that vche a kythyn kyng schuld com thider,
Vche duk wyth his duthe, & other dere lordes,
Schulde com to his court to kythe hym for lege,
& to reche hym reuerens, & his reuel herkken,
To loke on his lemanes & ladis hem calle.
To rose hym in his rialty rych men soghtten,
& mony a baroun ful bolde, to Babyloyn the noble.
ther bowed toward Babiloyn burnes so mony,
Kynges, cayseres ful kene, to the court wonnen,
Mony ludisch lordes that ladies broghten,
that to neuen the noumbre to much nye were.
For the bourghwatz so brod & so bigge alce,
Stalled in the fayrest stud the sterrez anvnder,
Prudly on a plat playn, plek alther-fayrest,
Vmbesweyed on vch a syde with seuen grete wateres,
With a wonder wroght walle wruxeled ful highe,
With koynt carneles aboue, coruen ful clene,
Troched toures bitwene, twenty spere lenthe,
& thiker throwen vmbethour with ouerthwert palle.

Watz longe & ful large & euer ilych sware,
& vch a syde vpon soyle helde seuen myle,
& the saudans sete sette in the myddes.
that watz a palayce of pryde passande alle other,
Bothe of werk & of wunder, & walle[d] al aboute;
Heghe houses withinne, the halle to hit med,
So brod bilde in a bay that blonkkes myght renne.
When the terme of the tyde watz towched of the feste,
Dere droghen therto & vpon des metten,
& Baltazar vpon bench was busked to sete,
Stepe stayred stones of his stoute throne.
thenne watz alle the halle flor hiled with knyghtes,
& barounes at the sidebordes bounet aywhere,
For non watz dressed vpon dece bot the dere seluen,
& his clere concubynes in clothes ful bryght.
When alle segges were thet set then seruyse bygynnes,
Sturnen trumpen strake steuen in halle,
Aywhere by the wowes wrasten krakkes,
& brode baneres therbi blusnande of gold,
Burnes berande the bredes vpon brode skeles
that were of sylueren syght, & served therwyth,
Lyfte logges therouer & on lofte coruen,
Pared out of paper & poynted of golde,
Brothe baboynes abof, besttes anvnder,
Foles in foler flakerande bitwene,
& al in asure & ynde enaumayld ryche;
& al on blonkken bak bere hit on honde.
& ay the nakeryn noyse, notes of pipes,
Tymbres & tabornes, tulket among,
Symbales & sonetez sware the noyse,
& bougounz busch batered so thikke.
So watz serued fele sythe the sale alle aboute,
With solace at the sere course, bifore the self lorde,

So faste thay weghed to him wyne hit warmed his hert
& breythed vppe into his brayn & blemyst his mynde,
& al waykned his wyt, & welneghe he foles;
For he waytez on wyde, his wenches he byholdes,
& his bolde baronage aboute bi the woghes.
thenne a dotage ful depe drof to his hert,
& a caytif counsayl he caght bi hymseluen;
Maynly his marschal the mayster vpon calles,
& comaundes hym cofly coferes to lauce,
& fech forth the vessel that his fader broght,
Nabugo_de_nozar, noble in his strenthe,
Conquered with his knyghtes & of kyrk rafte
In Jude, in Jerusalem, in gentyle wyse:
'Bryng hem now to my borde, of beuerage hem fylles,
Let thise ladyes of hem lape, I luf hem in hert;
that schal I cortaysly kythe, & thay schin knawe sone,
ther is no bounte in burne lyk Baltazar thewes.'
thenne towched to the tresour this tale watz sone,
& he with keyes vncloses kystes ful mony;
Mony burthen ful bryght watz broght into halle,
& couered mony a cupborde with clothes ful quite.
the jueles out of Jerusalem with gemmes ful bryght
Bi the syde of the sale were semely arayed;
the athel auter of brasse watz hade into place,

that hade ben blessed bifore wyth bischopes hondes

In the solempne sacrefyce that goud sauor hade
Bifore the Lorde of the lyfte in louyng Hymseluen,
Now is sette, for to serue Satanas the blake,
Bifore the bolde Baltazar wyth bost & wyth pryde;
Houen vpon this auter watz athel vessel
that wyth [s]o curious a crafte coruen watz wyly.
Salamon sete him s[eue]n ghere & a sythe more,
With alle the syence that hym sende the souerayn Lorde,
For to compas & kest to haf hem clene wroght.
For ther wer bassynes ful bryght of brende golde clere,
Enaumaylde with azer, & eweres of sute,
Couered cowpes foul clene, as casteles arayed,
Enbaned vnder batelment with bantelles quoynt,
& fyled out of fygures of ferlyle schappes.
the coperounes of the canacles that on the cuppe reres
Wer fetysely formed out in fylyoles longe;
Pinacles pyght ther apert that profert bitwene,
& al bolled abof with braunches & leues,
Pyes & papejayes purtrayed withinne,
As thay prudly hade piked of pomgarnades;
For alle the blomes of the boghes wer blyknande perles,
& alle the fruyt in tho formes of flaumbeande gemmes,
Ande safyres, & sardiners, & semely topace,
Alabaundarynes, & amaraunz, & amaffised stones,
Casydoynes, & crysolytes, & clere rubies,
Penitotes, & pynkardines, ay perles bitwene;
So trayled & tryfled atrauerce wer alle,
Bi vche bekyrande the bolde, the brurdes al vmbe;
the gobelotes of golde grauen aboute,
& fyoles fretted with flores & fleez of golde;
Vpon that avter watz al aliche dresset.
the candelstik bi a cost watz cayred thider sone,
Vpon the pyleres apyked, that praysed hit mony,
Vpon hit basez of brasse that ber vp the werkes,
the boghes bryght therabof, brayden of golde,
Braunches bredande theron, & bryddes ther seten
Of mony kyndes, of fele kyn hues,
As thay with wynge vpon wynde hade waged her fytheres.
Inmong the leues of the lampes wer graythed,
& other louflych lyght that lemed ful fayre,
As mony morteres of wax merkked withoute
With mony a borlych best al of brende golde.
Hit watz not wonte in that wone to wast no serges,
Bot in temple of the trauthe trwly to stonde
Bifore the sancta sanctorum, sothefast Dryghtyn
Expouned His speche spiritually to special prophetes.
Leue thou wel that the Lorde that the lyfte ghemes
Displesed much at that play in that plyt stronge,
that His jueles so gent wyth jaueles wer fouled,
that presyous in His presens wer proued sumwhyle.
Soberly in His sacrafyce summe wer anoynted,
thurghthe somones of Himselfe that syttes so hyghe;
Now a boster on benche bibbes therof
Tyl he be dronkken as the deuel, & dotes ther he syttes.
So the Worcher of this worlde wlates therwyth
that in the poynt of her play He poruayes a mynde;
Bot er harme hem He wolde in haste of His yre,
He wayned hem a warnyng that wonder hem thoght.
Nov is alle this guere geten glotounes to serue,
Stad in a ryche stal, & stared ful bryght[e];
Baltazar in a brayd: 'Bede vus therof!
Weghe wyn in this won! Wassayl!' he cryes.
Swyfte swaynes ful swythe swepen thertylle,
Kyppe kowpes in honde kyngez to serue;
In bryght bollez ful bayn birlen thise other,
& vche mon for his mayster machches alone.
ther watz rynging, on ryght, of ryche metalles,
Quen renkkes in that ryche rok rennen hit to cache;
Clatering of couaclez that kesten tho burdes
As sonet out of sau[t]eray songe als myry.
then the dotel on dece drank that he myght;
& thenne arn dressed dukez & prynces,
Concubines & knyghtes, bi cause of that merthe;
As vchon hade hym inhelde he haled of the cuppe.
So long likked thise lordes thise lykores swete,
& gloryed on her falce goddes, & her grace calles,
that were of stokkes & stones, stille euermore,
Neuer steuen hem astel, so stoken [is] hor tonge.
Alle the goude golden goddes the gaulez ghet neuenen,
Belfagor & Belyal, & Belssabub als,
Heyred hem as hyghly as heuen wer thayres,
Bot Hym that alle goudes giues, that God thay forgheten.
For ther a ferly bifel that fele folk seghen;
Fryst knew hit the kyng & alle the cort after:
In the palays pryncipale, vpon the playn wowe,
In contrary of the candelstik, that clerest hit schyned,
ther apered a paume, with poyntel in fyngres,
that watz grysly & gret, & grymly he wrytes;
Non other forme bot a fust faylande the wryste
Pared on the parget, purtrayed lettres.
When that bolde Baltazar blusched to that neue,
Such a dasande drede dusched to his hert
that al falewed his face & fayled the chere;
the stronge strok of the stonde strayned his joyntes,
His cnes cachches toclose, & cluchches his hommes,
& he with plattyng his paumes displayes his ler[e]s,
& romyes as a rad ryth that rorez for drede,
Ay biholdand the honde til hit hade al grauen
& rasped on the roghwoghe runisch sauez.
When hit the scrypture hade scraped wyth a strof penne,
As a coltour in clay cerues tho forghes,
thenne hit vanist verayly & voyded of syght,
Bt the lettres bileued ful large vpon plaster.
Sone so the kynge for his care carping myght wynne,
He bede his burnes boghto that were bok-lered,
To wayte the wryt that hit wolde, & wyter hym to say,
'For al hit frayes my flesche, the fyngres so grymme.'
Scoleres skelten theratte the skyl for to fynde,
Bot ther watz neuer on so wyse couthe on worde rede,
Ne what ledisch lore ne langage nauther,
What tythyng ne tale tokened tho draghtes.
thenne the bolde Baltazar bred ner wode,
& ede the cete to seche segges thurghout
that wer wyse of wychecrafte, & warlaghes other
that con dele wyth demerlayk & deuine lettres.
'Calle hem alle to my cort, tho Calde clerkkes,
Vnfolde hem alle this ferly that is bifallen here,
& calle wyth a highe cry: "He that the kyng wysses,
In expounyng of speche that spredes in thise lettres,
& make the mater to malt my mynde wythinne,
that I may wyterly wyt what that wryt menes,
He schal be gered ful gaye in gounes of porpre,
& a coler of cler golde clos vmbe his throte;
He schal be prymate & prynce of pure clergye,
& of my threuenest lordez the thrydde he schal,
& of my reme the rychest to ryde wyth myseluen,
Outtaken bare two, & thenne he the thrydde."'
this cry watz vpcaste, & ther comen mony
Clerkes out of Caldye that kennest wer knauen,
As the sage sathrapas that sorsory couthe,
Wychez & walkyries wonnen to that sale,
Deuinores of demorlaykes that dremes cowthe rede,
Sorsers & exorsismus & fele such clerkes;
& alle that loked on that letter as lewed thay were
As thay had loked in the lether of my lyft bote.
thenne cryes the kyng & kerues his wedes.
What! he corsed his clerkes & calde hem chorles;
To henge the harlotes he heghed ful ofte:
So watz the wyghe wytles he wed wel ner.
Ho herde hym chyde to the chambre that watz the chef quene.
When ho watz wytered bi wyghes what watz the cause,
Suche a chaungande chaunce in the chef halle,
the lady, to lauce that los that the lorde hade,
Glydes doun by the grece & gos to the kyng.
Ho kneles on the colde erthe & carpes to hymseluen
Wordes of worchyp wyth a wys speche.
'Kene kyng,' quoth the quene, 'kayser of vrthe,
Euer laste thy lyf in lenthe of dayes!
Why hatz thou rended thy robe for redles hereinne,
thaghthose ledes ben lewed lettres to rede,
& hatz a hathel in thy holde, as I haf herde ofte,
that hatz the gostes of God that gyes alle sothes?
His sawle is ful of syence, saghes to schawe,
To open vch a hide thyng of aunteres vncowthe.
that is he that ful ofte hatz heuened thy fader
Of mony anger ful hote with his holy speche.
When Nabugo_de_nozar watz nyed in stoundes,
He devysed his dremes to the dere trawthe;
He keuered hym with his counsayl of caytyf wyrdes;
Alle that he spured hym, in space he expowned clene,
thurghthe sped of the spyryt, that sprad hym withinne,
Of the godelest goddez that gaynes aywhere.
For his depe diuinite & his dere sawes,
thy bolde fader Baltazar bede by his name,
that now is demed Danyel, of derne coninges,
that caght watz in the captyuide in cuntre of Jues;
Nabuzardan hym nome, & now is he here,
A prophete of that prouince & pryce of the worlde.
Sende into the cete to seche hym bylyue,
& wynne hym with the worchyp to wayne the bote;
& thaghthe mater be merk that merked is ghender,
He schal declar hit also as hit on clay stande.'
that gode counseyl at the quene watz cached as swythe;
the burne byfore Baltazar watz broght in a whyle.
When he com bifore the kyng & clanly had halsed,
Baltazar vmbebrayde hym, & 'Leue sir,' he sayde,
'Hit is tolde me bi tulkes that thou trwe were
Profete of that prouynce that prayed my fader,
Ande that thou hatz in thy hert holy connyng,
Of sapyence thi sawle ful, sothes to schawe;
Goddes gost is the geuen that gyes alle thynges,
& thou vnhyles vch hidde that Heuen-Kyng myntes.
& here is a ferly byfallen, & I fayn wolde
Wyt the wytte of the wryt that on the wowe clyues,
For alle Calde clerkes han cowwardely fayled.
If thou with quayntyse con quere hit, I quyte the thy mede:
For if thou redes hit by ryght & hit to resoun brynges,
Fyrst telle me the tyxte of the tede lettres,
& sythen the mater of the mode mene me therafter,
& I schal halde the the hest that I the hyght haue,
Apyke the in porpre clothe, palle alther-fynest,
& the byghe of bryght golde abowte thyn nekke,
& the thryd thryuenest that thrynges me after,
thou schal be baroun vpon benche, bede I the no lasse.'
Derfly thenne Danyel deles thyse wordes:
'Ryche kyng of this rengne, rede the oure Lorde!
Hit is surely soth the Souerayn of heuen
Fylsened euer thy fader & vpon folde cheryched,
Gart hym grattest to be of gouernores alle,
& alle the worlde in his wylle welde as hym lykes.
Whoso wolde wel do, wel hym bityde,
& quos deth so he dezyre, he dreped als fast;
Whoso hym lyked to lyft, on lofte watz he sone,
& quoso hym lyked to lay watz loghed bylyue.
So watz noted the note of Nabugo_de_nozar,
Styfly stabled the rengne bi the stronge Dryghtyn,
For of the Hyghest he hade a hope in his hert,
that vche pouer past out of that Prynce euen.
& whyle that watz cleght clos in his hert
there watz no mon vpon molde of myght as hymseluen;
Til hit bitide on a tyme towched hym pryde
For his lordeschyp so large & his lyf ryche;
He hade so huge an insyght to his aune dedes
that the power of the hyghe Prynce he purely forghetes.
thenne blynnes he not of blasfemy on to blame the Dryghtyn;
His myght mete to Goddes he made with his wordes:
"I am god of the grounde, to gye as me lykes.
As He that hyghe is in heuen, His aungeles that weldes.
If He hatz formed the folde & folk thervpone,
I haf bigged Babiloyne, burghalther-rychest,
Stabled therinne vche a ston in strenkthe of myn armes;
Moght neuer myght bot myn make such another."
Watz not this ilke worde wonnen of his mowthe one
Er thenne the Souerayn saghe souned in his eres:
"Now Nabugo_de_nozar innoghe hatz spoken,
Now is alle thy pryncipalte past at ones,
& thou, remued fro monnes sunes, on mor most abide
& in wasturne walk & wyth the wylde dowelle,
As best, byte on the bent of braken & erbes,
With wrothe wolfes to won & wyth wylde asses."
Inmydde the poynt of his pryde departed he there
Fro the soly of his solempnete; his solace he leues,
& carfully is outkast to contre vnknawen,
Fer into a fyr fryth there frekes neuer comen.
His hert heldet vnhole; he hoped non other
Bot a best that he be, a bol other an oxe.
He fares forth on alle faure, fogge watz his mete,
& ete ay as a horce when erbes were fallen;
thus he countes hym a kow that watz a kyng ryche,
Quyle seuen sythez were ouerseyed, someres I trawe.
By that mony thik thyghe thryght vmbe his lyre,
that alle watz dubbed & dyght in the dew of heuen;
Faxe, fyltered & felt, flosed hym vmbe,
that schad fro his schulderes to his schyre wykes,
& twenty-folde twynande hit to his tos raght,
ther mony clyuy as clyde hit clyght togeder.
His berde ibrad alle his brest to the bare vrthe,
His browes bresed as breres aboute his brode chekes;
Holghe were his yghen & vnder campe hores,
& al watz gray as the glede, with ful grymme clawres
that were croked & kene as the kyte paune;
Erne-hwed he watz & al ouerbrawden,
Til he wyst ful wel who wroght alle myghtes,
& cowthe vche kyndam tokerue & keuer when Hym lyked.
thenne He wayned hym his wyt, that hade wo soffered,
that he com to knawlach & kenned hymseluen;
thenne he loued that Lorde & leued in trawthe
Hit watz non other then He that hade al in honde.
thenne sone watz he sende agayn, his sete restored;
His barounes boghed hym to, blythe of his come,
Hagherly in his aune hwe his heued watz couered,
& so gheply watz gharked & gholden his state.
Bot thou, Baltazar, his barne & his bolde ayre,
Seghthese syngnes with syght & set hem at lyttel,
Bot ay hatz hofen thy hert agaynes the hyghe Dryght[y]n,
With bobaunce & with blasfamye bost at Hym kest,
& now His vessayles avyled in vanyte vnclene,
that in His hows Hym to honour were heuened of fyrst;
Bifore the barounz hatz hom broght, & byrled therinne
Wale wyne to thy wenches in waryed stoundes;
Bifore thy borde hatz thou broght beuerage in thede,
that blythely were fyrst blest with bischopes hondes,
Louande theron lese goddez that lyf haden neuer,
Made of stokkes & stonez that neuer styry moght.
& for that frothande fylthe, the Fader of heuen
Hatz sende into this sale thise syghtes vncowthe,
the fyste with the fyngeres that flayed thi hert,
that rasped renyschly the woghe with the roghpenne.
thise ar the wordes here wryten, withoute werk more,
By vch fygure, as I fynde, as oure Fader lykes:
Mane, Techal, Phares: merked in thrynne,
that thretes the of thyn vnthryfte vpon thre wyse.
Now expowne the this speche spedly I thenk:
Manemenes als much as "Maynful Gode
Hatz counted thy kyndam bi a clene noumbre,
& fulfylled hit in fayth to the fyrre ende".
To teche the of Techal, that terme thus menes:
"thy wale rengne is walt in weghtes to heng,
& is funde ful fewe of hit fayth-dedes."
& Pharesfolghes for those fawtes, to frayst the trawthe;
In Phares fyndeI forsothe thise felle saghes:
"Departed is thy pryncipalte, depryued thou worpes,
thy rengne rafte is the fro, & raght is the Perses;
the Medes schal be maysteres here, & thou of menske schowued."'
the kyng comaunded anon to clethe that wyse
In frokkes of fyn cloth, as forward hit asked;
thenne sone watz Danyel dubbed in ful dere porpor,
& a coler of cler golde kest vmbe his swyre.
then watz demed a decre bi the duk seluen:
Bolde Baltazar bed that hym bowe schulde
the comynes al of Calde that to the kyng longed,
As to the prynce pryuyest preued the thrydde,
Heghest of alle other saf onelych tweyne,
To boghafter Baltazar in borghe & in felde.
thys watz cryed & knawen in cort als fast,
& alle the folk therof fayn that folghed hym tylle.
Bot howso Danyel watz dyght, that day ouerghede;
Nyght neghed ryght now with nyes fol mony,
For daghed neuer another day, that ilk derk after,
Er dalt were that ilk dome that Danyel deuysed.
the solace of the solempnete in that sale dured
Of that farand fest, tyl fayled the sunne;
thenne blykned the ble of the bryght skwes,
Mourkenes the mery weder, & the myst dryues
thorghthe lyst of the lyfte, bi the loghmedoes.
Vche hathel to his home hyghes ful fast,
Seten at her soper & songen therafter;
then foundez vch a felaghschyp fyrre at forth naghtes.
Baltazar to his bedd with blysse watz caryed;
Reche the rest as hym lyst: he ros neuer therafter.
For his foes in the felde in flokkes ful grete,
that longe hade layted that lede his londes to strye,
Now ar thay sodenly assembled at the self tyme.
Of hem wyst no wyghe that in that won dowelled.
Hit watz the dere Daryus, the duk of thise Medes,
the prowde prynce of Perce, & Porros of Ynde,
With mony a legioun ful large, with ledes of armes,
that now hatz spyed a space to spoyle Caldeez.
thay throngen theder in the thester on thrawen hepes,
Asscaped ouer the skyre watteres & scathed the walles,
Lyfte laddres ful longe & vpon lofte wonen,
Stelen stylly the toun er any steuen rysed.
Withinne an oure of the niyght an entre thay hade,
ghet afrayed thay no freke. Fyrre thay passen,
& to the palays pryncipal thay aproched ful stylle,
thenne ran thay in on a res on rowtes ful grete;
Blastes out of bryght brasse brestes so hyghe,
Ascry scarred on the scue, that scomfyted mony.
Segges slepande were slayne er thay slyppe myght;
Vche hous heyred watz withinne a hondewhyle.
Baltazar in his bed watz beten to dethe,
that bothe his blod & his brayn blende on the clothes;
The kyng in his cortyn watz kaght bi the heles,
Feryed out bi the fete & fowle dispysed.
that watz so doghty that day & drank of the vessayl
Now is a dogge also dere that in a dych lygges.
For the mayster of thyse Medes on the morne ryses,
Dere Daryous that day dyght vpon trone,
that cete seses ful sounde, & saghtlyng makes
Wyth alle the barounz theraboute, that bowed hym after.
& thus watz that londe lost for the lordes synne,
& the fylthe of the freke that defowled hade
the ornementes of Goddez hous that holy were maked.
He watz corsed for his vnclannes, & cached therinne,
Done doun of his dyngnete for dedez vnfayre,
& of thyse worldes worchyp wrast out for euer,
& ghet of lykynges on lofte letted, I trowe:
To loke on oure lofly Lorde late bitydes.
thus vpon thrynne wyses I haf yow thro schewed
that vnclannes tocleues in corage dere
Of that wynnelych Lorde that wonyes in heuen,
Entyses Hym to be tene, telled vp His wrake;
Ande clannes is His comfort, & coyntyse He louyes,
& those that seme arn & swete schyn se His face.
that we gon gay in oure gere that grace He vus sende,
that we may serue in His syght, ther solace neuer blynnez.
Amen.
