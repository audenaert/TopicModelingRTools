Pacience is a poynt, thagh hit displese ofte.
When heuy herttes ben hurt wyth hethyng other elles,
Suffraunce may aswag[en] hem & the swleme lethe,
For ho quelles vche a qued & quenches malyce;
For quoso suffer cowthe syt, sele wolde folghe,
& quo for thro may noght thole, the thikker he sufferes.
then is better to abyde the bur vmbestoundes
then ay throw forth my thro, thagh me thynk ylle.
I herde on a halyday, at a hyghe masse,
How Mathew melede that his Mayster His meyny con teche.
Aght happes He hem hyght & vcheon a mede,
Sunderlupes, for hit dissert, vpon a ser wyse:
Thay arn happen that han in hert pouerte,
For hores is the heuen-ryche to holde for euer;
thay ar happen also that haunte mekenesse,
For thay schal welde this worlde & alle her wylle haue;
Thay ar happen also that for her harme wepes,
For thay schal comfort encroche in kythes ful mony;
thay ar happen also that hungeres after ryght,
For thay schal frely be refete ful of alle gode;
Thay ar happen also that han in hert rauthe,
For mercy in alle maneres her mede schal worthe;
thay ar happen also that arn of hert clene,
For thay her Sauyour in sete schal se with her yghen;
Thay ar happen also that halden her pese,
For thay the gracious Godes sunes schal godly be called;
thay ar happen also that con her hert stere,
For hores is the heuen-ryche, as I er sayde.
These arn the happes alle aght that vus bihyght weren,
If we thyse ladyes wolde lof in lyknyng of thewes:
Dame Pouert, Dame Pitee, Dame Penaunce the thrydde,
Dame Mekenesse, Dame Mercy, & miry Clannesse,
& thenne Dame Pes, & Pacyence put in therafter.
He were happen that hade one; alle were the better.
Bot [s]yn I am put to a poynt that pouerte hatte,
I schal me poruay pacyence & play me with bothe,
For in the tyxte there thyse two arn in teme layde,
Hit arn fettled in on forme, the forme & the laste,
& by quest of her quoyntyse enquylen on mede.
& als, in myn vpynyoun, hit arn of on kynde:
For theras pouert hir proferes ho nyl be put vtter,
Bot lenge wheresoeuer hir lyst, lyke other greme;
& thereas pouert enpresses, thagh mon pyne thynk,
Much, maugre his mun, he mot nede suffer;
Thus pouerte & pacyence arn nedes playferes.
Sythen I am sette with hem samen, suffer me byhoues;
thenne is me lyghtloker hit lyke & her lotes prayse,
thenne wyther wyth & be wroth & the wers haue.
ghif me be dyght a destyne due to haue,
What dowes me the dedayn, other dispit make?
Other ghif my lege lorde lyst on lyue me to bidde
Other to ryde other to renne to Rome in his ernde,
What graythed me the grychchyng bot grame more seche?
Much ghif he me ne made, maugref my chekes,
& thenne thrat moste I thole & vnthonk to mede,
the had bowed to his bode bongre my hyure.
Did not Jonas in Jude suche jape sumwhyle?
To sette hym to sewrte, vnsounde he hym feches.
Wyl ghe tary a lyttel tyne & tent me a whyle,
I schal wysse yow therwyth as holy wryt telles.
Hit bitydde sumtyme in the termes of Jude,
Jonas joyned watz therinne Jentyle prophete;
Goddes glam to hym glod that hym vnglad made,
With a roghlych rurd rowned in his ere:
'Rys radly,' He says, '& rayke forth euen;
Nym the way to Nynyue wythouten other speche,
& in that cete My saghes soghe alle aboute,
that in that place, at the poynt, I put in thi hert.
For iwysse hit arn so wykke that in that won dowellez
& her malys is so much, I may not abide,
Bot venge Me on her vilanye & venym bilyue;
Now sweghe Me thider swyftly & say Me this arende.'
When that steuen watz stynt that stown[e]d his mynde,
Al he wrathed in his wyt, & wytherly he thoght:
'If I bowe to His bode & bryng hem this tale,
& I be nummen in Nuniue, my nyes begynes:
He telles me those traytoures arn typped schrewes;
I com wyth those tythynges, thay ta me bylyue,
Pynez me in a prysoun, put me in stokkes,
Wrythe me in a warlok, wrast out myn yghen.
this is a meruayl message a man for to preche
Amonge enmyes so mony & mansed fendes,
Bot if my gaynlych God such gref to me wolde,
Fo[r] desert of sum sake that I slayn were.
At alle peryles,' quoth the prophete, 'I aproche hit no nerre.
I wyl me sum other waye that He ne wayte after;
I schal tee into Tarce & tary there a whyle,
& lyghtly when I am lest He letes me alone.'
thenne he ryses radly & raykes bilyue,
Jonas toward port Japh, ay janglande for tene
that he nolde thole for nothyng non of those pynes,
thagh the Fader that hym formed were fale of his hele.
'Oure Syre syttes,' he says, 'on sege so hyghe
In His g[lo]wande glorye, & gloumbes ful lyttel
thagh I be nummen in Nunniue & naked dispoyled,
On rode rwly torent with rybaudes mony.'
thus he passes to that port his passage to seche,
Fyndes he a fayr schyp to the fare redy,
Maches hym with the maryneres, makes her paye
For to towe hym into Tarce as tyd as thay myght.
Then he tron on tho tres, & thay her tramme ruchen,
Cachen vp the crossayl, cables thay fasten,
Wight at the wyndas weghen her ankres,
Spende spak to the sprete the spare bawelyne,
Gederen to the gyde-ropes, the grete cloth falles,
thay layden in on laddeborde, & the lofe wynnes,
the blythe brethe at her bak the bosum he fyndes;
He swenges me thys swete schip swefte fro the hauen.
Watz neuer so joyful a Jue as Jonas watz thenne,
that the daunger of Dryghtyn so derfly ascaped;
He wende wel that that Wygh that al the world planted
Hade no maght in that mere no man for to greue.
Lo, the wytles wrechche! For he wolde noght suffer,
Now hatz he put hym in plyt of peril wel more.
Hit watz a wenyng vnwar that welt in his mynde,
thagh he were soght fro Samarye, that God segh no fyrre.
ghise, He blusched ful brode: that burde hym by sure;
that ofte kyd hym the carpe that kyng sayde,
Dyngne Dauid on des that demed this speche
In a psalme that he set the sauter withinne:
'O folez in folk, felez otherwhyle
& vnderstondes vmbestounde, thagh he be stape fole,
Hope ghe that He heres not that eres alle made?
Hit may not be that He is blynde that bigged vche yghe.'
Bot he dredes no dynt that dotes for elde.
For he watz fer in the flod foundande to Tarce,
Bot I trow ful tyd ouertan that he were,
So that schomely to schort he schote of his ame.
For the Welder of wyt that wot alle thynges,
that ay wakes & waytes, at wylle hatz He slyghtes.
He calde on that ilk crafte He carf with His hondes;
thay wakened wel the wrotheloker for wrothely He cleped:
'Ewrus & Aquiloun that on est sittes
Blowes bothe at My bode vpon blo watteres.'
thenne watz no tom ther bytwene His tale & her dede,
So bayn wer thay bothe two His bone for to wyrk.
Anon out of the north-est the noys bigynes,
When bothe brethes con blowe vpon blo watteres.
Rogh rakkes ther ros with rudnyng anvnder;
the see soughed ful sore, gret selly to here;
the wyndes on the wonne water so wrastel togeder
that the wawes ful wode waltered so highe
& efte busched to the abyme, that breed fysches
Durst nowhere for rogh arest at the bothem.
When the breth & the brok & the bote metten,
Hit watz a joyles gyn that Jonas watz inne,
For hit reled on roun vpon the roghe ythes.
the bur ber to hit baft, that braste alle her gere,
then hurled on a hepe the helme & the sterne;
Furst tomurte mony rop & the mast after;
the sayl sweyed on the see, thenne suppe bihoued
the coge of the [co]lde water, & thenne the cry ryses.
ghet coruen thay the cordes & kest al theroute;
Mony ladde ther forth lep to laue & to kest,
Scopen out the scathel water that fayn scape wolde,
For be monnes lode neuer so luther, the lyf is ay swete.
ther watz busy ouer borde bale to kest,
Her bagges & her fether-beddes & her bryght wedes,
Her kysttes & her coferes, her caraldes alle,
& al to lyghten that lome, ghif lethe wolde schape.
Bot euer watz ilyche loud the lot of the wyndes,
& euer wrother the water & wodder the stremes.
then tho wery forwroght wyst no bote,
Bot vchon glewed on his god that gayned hym beste:
Summe to Vernagu ther vouched avowes solemne,
Summe to Diana deuout & derf Nepturne,
To Mahoun & to Mergot, the mone & the sunne,
& vche lede as he loued & layde had his hert.
thenne bispeke the spakest, dispayred wel nere:
'I leue here be sum losynger, sum lawles wrech,
that hatz greued his god & gotz here amonge vus.
Lo, al synkes in his synne & for his sake marres.
I lovue that we lay lotes on ledes vchone,
& whoso lympes the losse, lay hym theroute;
& quen the gulty is gon, what may gome trawe
Bot He that rules the rak may rwe on those other?'
this watz sette in asent, & sembled thay were,
Herghed out of vche hyrne to hent that falles.
A lodesmon lyghtly lep vnder hachches,
For to layte mo ledes & hem to lote bryng.
Bot hym fayled no freke that he fynde myght,
Saf Jonas the Jwe, that jowked in derne.
He watz flowen for ferde of the flode lotes
Into the bothem of the bot, & on a brede lyggede,
Onhelde by the hurrok, for the heuen wrache,
Slypped vpon a sloumbe-selepe, & sloberande he routes.
the freke hym frunt with his fot & bede hym ferk vp:
ther Ragnel in his rakentes hym rere of his dremes!
Bi the haspede he hentes hym thenne,
& broght hym vp by the brest & vpon borde sette,
Arayned hym ful runyschly what raysoun he hade
In such slaghtes of sorghe to slepe so faste.
Sone haf thay her sortes sette & serelych deled,
& ay the lote vpon laste lymped on Jonas.
thenne ascryed thay hym sckete & asked ful loude:
'What the deuel hatz thou don, doted wrech?
What seches thou on see, synful schrewe,
With thy lastes so luther to lose vus vchone?
Hatz thou, gome, no gouernour ne god on to calle,
that thou thus slydes on slepe when thou slayn worthes?
Of what londe art thou lent, what laytes thou here,
Whyder in worlde that thou wylt, & what is thyn arnde?
Lo, thy dom is the dyght, for thy dedes ille.
Do gyf glory to thy godde, er thou glyde hens.'
'I am an Ebru,' quoth he, 'of Israyl borne;
that Wyghe I worchyp, iwysse, that wroght alle thynges,
Alle the worlde with the welkyn, the wynde & the sternes,
& alle that wonez ther withinne, at a worde one.
Alle this meschef for me is made at thys tyme,
For I haf greued my God & gulty am founden;
Forthy berez me to the borde & bathethes me theroute,
Er gete ghe no happe, I hope forsothe.'
He ossed hym by vnnynges that thay vndernomen
that he watz flawen fro the face of frelych Dryghtyn:
thenne such a ferde on hem fel & flayed hem withinne
that thay ruyt hym to rowwe, & letten the rynk one.
Hatheles hyghed in haste with ores ful longe,
Syn her sayl watz hem aslypped, on sydez to rowe,
Hef & hale vpon hyght to helpen hymseluen,
Bot al watz nedles note: that nolde not bityde.
In bluber of the blo flod bursten her ores.
thenne hade thay noght in her honde that hem help myght;
thenne nas no coumfort to keuer, ne counsel non other,
Bot Jonas into his juis jugge bylyue.
Fryst thay prayen to the Prynce that prophetes seruen
that He gef hem the grace to greuen Hym neuer,
that thay in balelez blod ther blenden her handez,
thagh that hathel wer His that thay here quelled.
Tyd by top & bi to thay token hym synne;
Into that lodlych loghe thay luche hym sone.
He watz no tytter outtulde that tempest ne sessed:
the se saghtled therwith as sone as ho moght.
thenne thagh her takel were torne that totered on ythes,
Styffe stremes & streght hem strayned a whyle,
that drof hem dryghlych adoun the depe to serue,
Tyl a swetter ful swythe hem sweghed to bonk.
ther watz louyng on lofte, when thay the londe wonnen,
To oure mercyable God, on Moyses wyse,
With sacrafyse vpset, & solempne vowes,
& graunted Hym vn to be God & graythly non other.
thagh thay be jolef for joye, Jonas ghet dredes;
thagh he nolde suffer no sore, his seele is on anter;
For whatso worthed of that wyghe fro he in water dipped,
Hit were a wonder to wene, ghif holy wryt nere.
Now is Jonas the Jwe jugged to drowne;
Of that schended schyp men schowued hym sone.
A wylde walterande whal, as Wyrde then schaped,
that watz beten fro the abyme, bi that bot flotte,
& watz war of that wyghe that the water soghte,
& swyftely swenged hym to swepe, & his swolgh opened;
the folk ghet haldande his fete, the fysch hym tyd hentes;
Withouten towche of any tothe he tult in his throte.
Thenne he swengez & swayues to the se bothem,
Bi mony rokkez ful roghe & rydelande strondes,
Wyth the mon in his mawe malskred in drede,
As lyttel wonder hit watz, ghif he wo dreghed,
For nade the hyghe Heuen-Kyng, thurgh His honde myght,
Warded this wrech man in warlowes guttez,
What lede moght lyue bi lawe of any kynde,
that any lyf myght be lent so longe hym withinne?
Bot he watz sokored by that Syre that syttes so highe,
thagh were wanlez of wele in wombe of that fissche,
& also dryuen thurgh the depe & in derk walterez.
Lorde, colde watz his cumfort, & his care huge,
For he knew vche a cace & kark that hym lymped,
How fro the bot into the blober watz with a best lachched,
& thrwe in at hit throte withouten thret more,
As mote in at a munster dor, so mukel wern his chawlez.
He glydes in by the giles thurgh glaym ande glette,
Relande in by a rop, a rode that hym thoght,
Ay hele ouer hed hourlande aboute,
Til he blunt in a blok as brod as a halle;
& ther he festnes the fete & fathmez aboute,
& stod vp in his stomak that stank as the deuel.
ther in saym & in sorghe that sauoured as helle,
ther watz bylded his bour that wyl no bale suffer.
& thenne he lurkkes & laytes where watz le best,
In vche a nok of his nauel, bot nowhere he fyndez
No rest ne recouerer, bot ramel ande myre,
In wych gut so euer he gotz, bot euer is God swete;
& ther he lenged at the last, & to the Lede called:
'Now, Prynce, of thy prophete pite thou haue.
thagh I be fol & fykel & falce of my hert,
Dewoyde now thy vengaunce, thurgh vertu of rauthe;
Thagh I be gulty of gyle, as gaule of prophetes,
thou art God, & alle gowdez ar graythely thyn owen.
Haf now mercy of thy man & his mysdedes,
& preue the lyghtly a Lorde in londe & in water.'
With that he hitte to a hyrne & helde hym therinne,
ther no defoule of no fylthe watz fest hym abute;
ther he sete also sounde, saf for merk one,
As in the bulk of the bote ther he byfore sleped.
So in a bouel of that best he bidez on lyue,
thre dayes & th[r]e nyght, ay thenkande on Dryghtyn,
His myght & His merci, His mesure thenne.
Now he knawez Hym in care that couthe not in sele.
Ande euer walteres this whal bi wyldren depe,
thurgh mony a regioun ful roghe, thurgh ronk of his wylle;
For that mote in his mawe mad hym, I trowe,
thagh hit lyttel were hym wyth, to wamel at his hert;
Ande as sayled the segge, ay sykerly he herde
the bygge borne on his bak & bete on his sydes.
then a prayer ful prest the prophete ther maked;
On this wyse, as I wene, his wordez were mony:
'Lorde, to the haf I cleped in carez ful stronge;
Out of the hole thou me herde of hellen wombe;
I calde, & thou knew myn vncler steuen.
thou diptez me of the depe se into the dymme hert,
the grete flem of thy flod folded me vmbe;
Alle the gotez of thy guferes & groundelez powlez,
& thy stryuande stremez of stryndez so mony,
In on daschande dam dryuez me ouer.
& ghet I say as I seet in the se bothem:
"Careful am I, kest out fro thy cler yghen
& deseuered fro thy syght; ghet surely I hope
Efte to trede on thy temple & teme to thyseluen."
I am wrapped in water to my wo stoundez;
the abyme byndes the body that I byde inne;
the pure poplande hourle playes on my heued;
To laste mere of vche a mount, Man, am I fallen;
the barrez of vche a bonk ful bigly me haldes,
that I may lachche no lont, & thou my lyf weldes.
thou schal releue me, Renk, whil thy ryght slepez,
thurgh myght of thy mercy that mukel is to tryste.
For when th'acces of anguych watz hid in my sawle,
thenne I remembred me ryght of my rych Lorde,
Prayande Him for pete His prophete to here,
that into His holy hous myn orisoun moght entre.
I haf meled with thy maystres mony longe day,
Bot now I wot wyterly that those vnwyse ledes
that affyen hym in vanyte & in vayne thynges
For think that mountes to noght her mercy forsaken;
Bot I dewoutly awowe, that verray betz halden,
Soberly to do the sacrafyse when I schal saue worthe,
& offer the for my hele a ful hol gyfte,
& halde goud that thou me hetes: haf here my trauthe.'
Thenne oure Fader to the fysch ferslych biddez
that he hym sput spakly vpon spare drye.
ther whal wendez at His wylle & a warthe fyndez,
& ther he brakez vp the buyrne as bede hym oure Lorde.
thenne he swepe to the sonde in sluchched clothes:
Hit may wel be that mester were his mantyle to wasche.
the bonk that he blosched to & bode hym bisyde
Wern of the regiounes ryght that he renayed hade.
thenne a wynde of Goddez worde efte the wyghe bruxlez:
'Nylt thou neuer to Nuniue bi no kynnez wayez?'
'ghisse, Lorde,' quoth the lede, 'lene me thy grace
For to go at thi gre: me gaynez [n]on other.'
'Ris, aproche then to prech, lo, the place here.
Lo, My lore is in the loke, lauce hit therinne.'
thenne the renk radly ros as he myght,
& to Niniue that naght he neghed ful euen;
Hit watz a cete ful syde & selly of brede;
On to threnge therthurghe watz thre dayes dede.
that on journay ful joynt Jonas hym ghede,
Er euer he warpped any worde to wyghe that he mette,
& thenne he cryed so cler that kenne myght alle
the trwe tenor of his teme; he tolde on this wyse:
'ghet schal forty dayez fully fare to an ende,
& thenne schal Niniue be nomen & to noght worthe;
Truly this ilk toun schal tylte to grounde;
Vp-so-doun schal ghe dumpe depe to the abyme,
To be swolghed swyftly wyth the swart erthe,
& alle that lyuyes hereinne lose the swete.'
this speche sprang in that space & spradde alle aboute,
To borges & to bacheleres that in that burgh lenged;
Such a hidor hem hent & a hatel drede,
that al chaunged her chere & chylled at the hert.
the segge sesed not ghet, bot sayde euer ilyche:
'the verray vengaunce of God schal voyde this place!'
thenne the peple pitosly pleyned ful stylle,
& for the drede of Dryghtyn doured in hert;
Heter hayrez thay hent that asperly bited,
& those thay bounden to her bak & to her bare sydez,
Dropped dust on her hede, & dymly bisoghten
that that penaunce plesed Him that playnez on her wronge.
& ay he cryes in that kyth tyl the kyng herde,
& he radly vpros & ran fro his chayer,
His ryche robe he torof of his rigge naked,
& of a hep of askes he hitte in the myddez.
He askez heterly a hayre & hasped hym vmbe,
Sewed a sekke therabof, & syked ful colde;
ther he dased in that duste, with droppande teres,
Wepande ful wonderly alle his wrange dedes.
thenne sayde he to his serjauntes: 'Samnes yow bilyue;
Do dryue out a decre, demed of myseluen,
that alle the bodyes that ben withinne this borgh quyk,
Bothe burnes & bestes, burdez & childer,
Vch prynce, vche prest, & prelates alle,
Alle faste frely for her falce werkes;
Sesez childer of her sok, soghe hem so neuer,
Ne best bite on no brom, ne no bent nauther,
Passe to no pasture, ne pike non erbes,
Ne non oxe to no hay, ne no horse to water.
Al schal crye, forclemmed, with alle oure clere strenthe;
the rurd schal ryse to Hym that rawthe schal haue;
What wote other wyte may ghif the Wyghe lykes,
that is hende in the hyght of His gentryse?
I wot His myght is so much, thagh He be myssepayed,
that in His mylde amesyng He mercy may fynde.
& if we leuen the layk of oure layth synnes,
& stylle steppen in the styghe He styghtlez Hymseluen,
He wyl wende of His wodschip & His wrath leue,
& forgif vus this gult, ghif we Hym God leuen.'
thenne al leued on His lawe & laften her synnes,
Parformed alle the penaunce that the prynce radde;
& God thurgh His godnesse forgef as He sayde;
thagh He other bihyght, withhelde His vengaunce.
Muche sorghe thenne satteled vpon segge Jonas;
He wex as wroth as the wynde towarde oure Lorde.
So hatz anger onhit his hert, [h]e callez
A prayer to the hyghe Prynce, for pyne, on thys wyse:
'I biseche the, Syre, now thou self jugge;
Watz not this ilk my worde that worthen is nouthe,
that I kest in my cuntre, when thou thy carp sendez
that I schulde tee to thys toun thi talent to preche?
Wel knew I thi cortaysye, thy quoynt soffraunce,
thy bounte of debonerte & thy bene grace,
thy longe abydyng wyth lur, thy late vengaunce;
& ay thy mercy is mete, be mysse neuer so huge.
I wyst wel, when I hade worded quatsoeuer I cowthe
To manace alle thise mody men that in this mote dowellez,
Wyth a prayer & a pyne thay myght her pese gete,
& therfore I wolde haf flowen fer into Tarce.
Now, Lorde, lach out my lyf, hit lastes to longe.
Bed me bilyue my bale-stour & bryng me on ende,
For me were swetter to swelt as swythe, as me thynk,
then lede lenger thi lore that thus me les makez.'
the soun of oure Souerayn then swey in his ere,
that vpbraydes this burne vpon a breme wyse:
'Herk, renk, is this ryght so ronkly to wrath
For any dede that I haf don other demed the ghet?'
Jonas al joyles & janglande vpryses,
& haldez out on est half of the hyghe place,
& farandely on a felde he fettelez hym to bide,
For to wayte on that won what schulde worthe after.
ther he busked hym a bour, the best that he myght,
Of hay & of euer-ferne & erbez a fewe,
For hit watz playn in that place for plyande greuez,
For to schylde fro the schene other any schade keste.
He bowed vnder his lyttel bothe, his bak to the sunne,
& ther he swowed & slept sadly al nyght,
the whyle God of His grace ded growe of that soyle
the fayrest bynde hym abof that euer burne wyste.
When the dawande day Dryghtyn con sende,
thenne wakened the wygh vnder wodbynde,
Loked alofte on the lef that lylled grene;
Such a lefsel of lof neuer lede hade,
For hit watz brod at the bothem, boghted on lofte,
Happed vpon ayther half, a hous as hit were,
A nos on the north syde & nowhere non ellez,
Bot al schet in a schaghe that schaded ful cole.
the gome glyght on the grene graciouse leues,
that euer wayued a wynde so wythe & so cole;
the schyre sunne hit vmbeschon, thagh no schafte myght
the mountaunce of a lyttel mote vpon that man schyne.
thenne watz the gome so glad of his gay logge,
Lys loltrande therinne lokande to toune;
So blythe of his wodbynde he balteres thervnde[r],
that of no diete that day the deuel haf he roght.
& euer he laghed as he loked the loge alle aboute,
& wysched hit were in his kyth ther he wony schulde,
On heghe vpon Effraym other Ermonnes hillez:
'Iwysse, a worthloker won to welde I neuer keped.'
& quen hit neghed to naght nappe hym bihoued;
He slydez on a sloumbe-slep sloghe vnder leues,
Whil God wayned a worme that wrot vpe the rote,
& wyddered watz the wodbynde bi that the wyghe wakned;
& sythen He warnez the west to waken ful softe,
& sayez vnte Zeferus that he syfle warme,
that ther quikken no cloude bifore the cler sunne,
& ho schal busch vp ful brode & brenne as a candel.
then wakened the wyghe of his wyl dremes,
& blusched to his wodbynde that brothely watz marred,
Al welwed & wasted tho worthelych leues;
the schyre sunne hade hem schent er euer the schalk wyst.
& then hef vp the hete & heterly brenned;
the warm wynde of the weste, wertes he swythez.
the man marred on the molde that moght hym not hyde
His wodbynde watz away, he weped for sorghe;
With hatel anger & hot, heterly he callez:
'A, thou Maker of man, what maystery the thynkez
thus thy freke to forfare forbi alle other?
With alle meschef that thou may, neuer thou me sparez;
I keuered me a cumfort that now is caght fro me,
My wodbynde so wlonk that wered my heued.
Bot now I se thou art sette my solace to reue;
Why ne dyghttez thou me to dighe? I dure to longe.'
ghet oure Lorde to the lede laused a speche:
'Is this ryghtwys, thou renk, alle thy ronk noyse,
So wroth for a wodbynde to wax so sone?
Why art thou so waymot, wyghe, for so lyttel?'
'Hit is not lyttel,' quoth the lede, 'bot lykker to ryght;
I wolde I were of this worlde wrapped in moldez.'
'thenne bythenk the, mon, if the forthynk sore,
If I wolde help My hondewerk, haf thou no wonder;
thou art waxen so wroth for thy wodbynde,
& trauayledez neuer to tent hit the tyme of an howre,
Bot at a wap hit here wax & away at another,
& ghet lykez the so luther, thi lyf woldez thou tyne.
thenne wyte not Me for the werk, that I hit wolde help,
& rwe on tho redles that remen for synne;
Fyrst I made hem Myself of materes Myn one,
& sythen I loked hem ful longe & hem on lode hade.
& if I My trauayl schulde tyne of termes so longe,
& type doun ghonder toun when hit turned were,
the sor of such a swete place burde synk to My hert,
So mony malicious mon as mournez therinne.
& of that soumme ghet arn summe, such sottez formadde,
As lyttel barnez on barme that neuer bale wroght,
& wymmen vnwytte that wale ne couthe
that on hande fro that other, fo[r] alle this hyghe worlde.
Bitwene the stele & the stayre disserne noght cunen,
What rule renes in roun bitwene the ryght hande
& his lyfte, thagh his lyf schulde lost be therfor;
& als ther ben doumbe bestez in the burgh mony,
that may not synne in no syt hemseluen to greue.
Why schulde I wrath wyth hem, sythen wyghez wyl torne,
& cum & cnawe Me for Kyng & My carpe leue?
Wer I as hastif a[s] thou heere, were harme lumpen;
Couthe I not thole bot as thou, ther thryued ful fewe.
I may not be so mal[i]cious & mylde be halden,
For malyse is nogh[t] to mayntyne boute mercy withinne.'
Be noght so gryndel, godman, bot go forth thy wayes,
Be preue & be pacient in payne & in joye;
For he that is to rakel to renden his clothez
Mot efte sitte with more vnsounde to sewe hem togeder.
Forthy when pouerte me enprecez & paynez innoghe
Ful softly with suffraunce saghttel me bihouez;
Forthy penaunce & payne topreue hit in syght
that pacience is a nobel poynt, thagh hit displese ofte.
Amen.
