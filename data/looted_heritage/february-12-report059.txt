Museum Thefts in Yorkshire

UK heritage under threat as treasures are stolen to orderA TREASURE trove of antiques and artefacts worth hundreds of thousands of pounds has been stolen from or damaged in Yorkshire’s museums and stately homes in recent years, a Yorkshire Post investigation has found.

In addition to a spate of thefts from the region’s most famous stately homes, in which priceless furniture, porcelain figurines, mantle clocks and gold trophies have been stolen to order, many other items which make up the county’s heritage has been lost or accidentally damaged, Freedom of Information requests have revealed.

The Museum of South Yorkshire Life at Cusworth Hall, near Doncaster, had an 1812 Pontefract Race Cup worth £35,000, a silver tankard dating back to 1848 and other rare items stolen four-and-a-half years ago. They have never been recovered.
