Sulaimaniya Museum Denies Buying Looted Artefact

Sulaimaniya Museum denies buying looted artifactLast month, CNN reported that Iraq’s second largest museum in Sulaimaniya bought stolen Mesopotamian artifacts from smugglers. Communicating with looters is considered unacceptable by the international archeological community because it might encourage looting. 

In December 31st, however, Hashim Hamah Abdullah, the Director of the Sulaimaniya Museum, stated that the museum did not communicate with any looters or smugglers, and that the Epic of Gilgamesh tablet that was recovered by the museum was a gift from a local citizen who received $600 as a thank you gesture from the local government.

The tablet, part of the Sulaimaniya Museum collection now, was written during the Old Babylonian Empire between 1800 and 900 BCE and it is considered one of the oldest democracy and civil society-related texts.
