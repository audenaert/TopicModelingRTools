Broughton Coin Theft

I know that a number of numismatists read LM ... so perhaps they could do their bit to help solve the theft of some coins from a house in the Scottish Borders.

Crimewatch finds potential Broughton coin theft leads

Police said they were "thrilled" with the response to a Crimewatch appeal over the theft of coins worth £500,000 in the Borders almost five years ago.

The "unique" collection was taken from the Broughton home of Lord and Lady Stewartby in June 2007.

An appeal for information was screened by the BBC on Thursday night.

About 40 calls have been received and Lothian and Borders Police said they would analyse the information received and follow up any new lines of inquiry.

The collection of early Scottish coins included some dating back nearly 900 years.

A £50,000 reward has been offered for any information leading to their return to their rightful owner.

Det Ch Insp Grant Dougall appealed for any dealers or collectors who might have seen the coins to get in touch.

"We believe it was a targeted raid because the thieves only took the coins and some jewellery stored with them," he said.

"We have conducted extensive inquiries across the country and to-date not a single coin from the collection has surfaced."

Phillip Skingley, of London coin dealers and auctioneers Spink, said the items were of great importance.

"Essentially they are all unique pieces of history in their own right," he said.

"Each one can tell us something about the social and economic history of the period in Scotland.

"This is on a par with the theft of a national treasure."
