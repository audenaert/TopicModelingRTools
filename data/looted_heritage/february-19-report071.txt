Faberge egg stolen from Worcester Park

A limited edition Faberge egg was stolen from a woman’s home on Friday, February 10.

The egg which was stolen from a property in Bridgewood Road, Worcester Park is one of 300 and is worth thousands of pounds.

However, what is more important to the owner is the sentimental value.

The owner, who suffered from breast cancer a few years ago, went on a Baltic cruise to celebrate her recovery.

Someone on the ship gave a talk about Theo Faberge, the grandson of Peter Carl Faberge, a Russian jeweller known for his eggs made with jewels and precious metals.

There was a chance to buy one of Theo Faberge’s eggs and the woman saw one she liked.

She said the egg is made from the same oak as the 18th century Shtandart ship, the first vessel of the Russian Baltic fleet , which was made with oak planted by Alexander the Great.

Theo Faberge was one of a few people allowed to purchase the wood.

She said: "It was just so beautiful."

There were also other items stolen in the burglary including five rings, two flat screen TV’s, a laptop and a portable DVD player.

However, of everything which was stolen it was the egg which was particularly special to the owner.

The egg is signed and numbered on the bottom.

It has a nautical theme and a small ruby on the top.
