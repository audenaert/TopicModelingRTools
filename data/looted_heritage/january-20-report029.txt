Two arrested for illegally trading antiquities on Rhodes 

Two men, an architect and a business man, were led before a Rhodes public prosecutor on Friday, accused of illegally trading in antiquities. Police found a total of 1,600 ancient artifacts in their possession, that they allegedly intended to sell for three million euros.
 
They were arrested by a team from the illegal antiquities squad that went to Rhodes, after they were tipped off by a private researcher that a major deal involving large quantities of illegally-owned antiquities was about to take place on the island.
 
On Thursday the officers conducted a search in the centre of Rhodes town, entering a souvenir shop owned by a 64-year-old local man. Arresting officers claim that the 64-year-old, assisted by a 58-year-old accomplice, attempted to move the ancient artifacts into the shop's storage loft as they entered, in order to conceal them.
 
The objects found included ancient amphorae, lamps, vases, pottery masks, stone idols, lead seals, coins and various others.
