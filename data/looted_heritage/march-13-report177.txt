This is a breakthrough project for at least a few reasons. First,

WikiLoot would bring out in the open information which has, as of yet,

only been selectively revealed: an unpublished archive of information

about looted antiquities seized by various law enforcement agencies over

the past two decades. With this archive online, anyone with an iPad or

laptop could walk into a museum, auction house or antiquities shop and

identify a looted pot or statue. Second, by creating WikiLoot, by

enabling anyone and everyone with the information and platform to engage

in the search for looted antiquities, the impact of the archive itself

in the fight against the looters and purveyors of illicit antiquates is

immeasurably magnified. Third, the existence of WikiLoot and the crowd

sourced identification of looted antiquities, would no doubt act as a

deterrent in the future purchase or consignment of antiquities of

dubious origins by museums, auction houses or antiquities purveyors.
