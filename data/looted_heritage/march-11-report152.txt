Ancient shekel sells for $1.1 million

Silver coin struck in first year of Jewish Revolt against Rome sold at a New York auction

An ancient Judean coin has sold for $1.1 million at a New York City auction.

The Year 1 prototype silver shekel from A.D. 66 was bought Thursday night at Heritage Auctions by a private East Coast collector.

It’s one of only two known Year 1 prototype silver shekels. The other one is in the collection of the Israel Museum.

It’s the first silver coin struck by Jewish forces revolting against Roman rule in the first century. It features an image of a ritual chalice and three pomegranates.

Heritage says it’s the highest price for any Judean coin paid at auction.

It’s one of 2,200 ancient Judean coins from the Shoshana Collection assembled by a private Los Angeles-area collector. He bought it at a 1991 auction for more than $240,000.
