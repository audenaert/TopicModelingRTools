Illicit digging at Gurob, Egypt

Some 170 pits produced through illegal digging in the concession area were recorded during the September 2011 season (see rough preliminary indication with red hatching in Fig.1 of the report[1]). One tomb (P022) was found to still contain a pottery coffin with burial inside. Due to unsafe conditions no attempt was made to recover this material which appears to have been previously disturbed. In the meantime the tomb pit was backfilled.

In addition to recording the location of these disturbances we have categorised the pits by significance:

Category 1: a small scrape on the surface

Category 2: a larger, but not significant hole

Category 3: a tomb-sized hole, causing significant damage, but not actually being a tomb

Category 4: a robbed tomb, but no significant damage has been done to it

Category 5: a robbed tomb requiring attention.
