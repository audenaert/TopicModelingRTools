Egyptian Stone Heart Scarab, Circa the Late Dynastic Period (700-400 B.C.)

PLEASE NOTE:  THIS IS A TRUE NO-RESERVE AUCTION WITH AN OPENING BID OF JUST $15.95!!! 

 

This auction is for an Egyptian Stone Heart Scarab, from the Late Dynastic Period (circa 700-400 B.C.). This hand-carved piece was fashioned into the shape of a scarab beetle. It was known as a heart scarab because it was placed over the chest of the mummy.    

 

This unusual piece is guaranteed to be genuine and as described. It measures nearly 7/8" in length, 3/4" in width, and over 1/4" thick, and is completely intact, with no discernable hieroglyphics. Please look at the pictures carefully, since the item photographed is the exact item you will receive. I am offering this very interesting piece at a starting price of just $15.95 with no reserve, although I personally paid multiples of that years ago, but it will go for whatever the bidding determines.

 

Terms and Payment: I accept PayPal only. Within the United States, the piece will ship by First-Class Mail with Delivery Confirmation through the U.S. Postal Service. Shipping charges are $3.95 for the first item and $1.00 for each additional item. Please check out my other offers, since I am happy to combine to save on shipping charges on any auctions which are won within any 24 hour time frame. California residents will be charged 8% sales tax. We charge $15 shipping for Registered First-Class Mail worldwide. Please do not ask us to lie on the description or valuation of the items on customs declarations or invoices, because this is illegal, and we don't do it. Although we will always ship promptly, international shipments can occasionally take over a month to be delivered, due to lengthy customs delays in some countries.
